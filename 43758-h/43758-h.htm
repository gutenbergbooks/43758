<p>The record of the Blizzard of 1891 was undertaken
in response to a generally expressed desire on the part
of a large number of residents in the Western Counties.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to compile the work,
imperfect as it is, without the assistance and co-operation
of the editor and staff of the <i>Western Morning
News</i>, who have been most active in its promotion.
Assistance has also been kindly rendered by the editor
and staff of the <i>Western Daily Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>Thanks are also largely due to many others, who,
besides furnishing us with interesting details and views,
have offered us every facility for obtaining information.</p>

<p>Valuable particulars in some instances have been
afforded by Dr. Merrifield, of Plymouth, and Mr. Rowe,
public librarian, of Devonport, who has also sent some
of the views appearing in this book.</p>

<p>To the artistic photographic skill of Messrs. Heath
and Son, of George Street, Plymouth, Messrs. Denney
and Co., of Exeter and Teignmouth, and Messrs.
Valentine and Son, of Teignmouth, we are indebted
for several of our illustrations. To the amateur
photographers in various parts of the West who so
kindly sent photographic views we tender our best
thanks, and regret that space did not permit us to
use a larger number.</p>

<p>Much necessarily remains untold, but we have
endeavoured to depict a very remarkable event as fully
as the pages at our disposal permitted.</p>

<h2>THE BLIZZARD IN THE WEST</h2>

INDICATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS.</h2>


<p>On the morning of the 9th of March, 1891, when
inhabitants of the three westernmost counties in England
set about preparing for the routine duties of daily life,
nothing seemed to indicate that, with the approach of
nightfall, the gravest atmospheric disturbance of the
century&mdash;in that part of the world, at all events&mdash;would
come to spread terror and destruction throughout town
and country. The month, so far, had not been a gentle
one. Following in the footsteps of a memorably genial
February, March had been somewhat harsh and cold,
without yielding the rain that was by this time greatly
needed. There were rumours of "a change of some
sort," of an approaching "fall of something," and other
vaticinations of the same familiar character floating about,
but in the west country these wise sayings fall so thick
and fast and frequently as to possess little more significance
than the most oft-repeated household words.
When the day drew on, and signs of a rising gale were
uncomfortably apparent on every hand, recollections of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
promised storm from the Observatories of the United
States began to be awakened, but it was found on sifting
the matter, that if this were the disturbance indicated, it
had come about a fortnight too soon. Students of "Old
Moore's Almanack" were better informed, and it is probable
that if this ill wind blew good to anybody, it was
in the shape of discovery that by virtue of the truth of
his forecast, a favourite and venerable prophet was
deserving of honour at the hands of the people of his
own country. Unhappily, however, there is nothing to
show that advantage had been taken of this warning, in
any practical sense. On the contrary, the blast came
down swiftly upon a community that was almost wholly
unprepared to receive it, and one of the saddest parts of
the story of its fury will be the account of the devastation
wrought among the unprotected flocks and herds.</p>

<p>On referring to the remarks on the subject of the
weather published in the local press, and obtained from
official scientific authorities, it will be found that at an
early hour on the morning of March 9th the barometer
had been rising slightly, and that the day "promised to
be fine." Other accounts hinted at the probability of
some snow showers, and snow was reported as falling
heavily in North Wales, but north and north-easterly
winds, light and moderate, were anticipated. Nothing
was said about a great fall of snow, accompanied by a
hurricane fierce enough to send it down in powder,
without even allowing time for the formation of snow-flakes.</p>

<p>According to one Plymouth correspondent, whose
observations are both reliable and valuable, the only
intimation of the coming storm was by the barometer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
falling to 29Â·69 on the evening of the 9th, with an
E.N.E. wind. The hygrometer was thick and heavy&mdash;a
sign of rough weather. During the night the glass fell
to 29Â·39. On Tuesday it fell to 29Â·180. Another
account says that it has not, perhaps, occurred in the
experience of many, except those who have known
tropical storms, that the movement in an ordinary
column barometer might be seen during the progress
of a gale. Such, however, was possible in the case
under notice. Though the glass had been falling during
the day, yet there were no indications of any serious
disturbance of the weather. On many occasions there
have been greater falls in the barometer than on this
occasion. When this storm was at its height, the
barometer at Devonport was observed to be at 29Â·27,
but in the course of half an hour pressure was indicated
by 29Â·20, the rise being, of course, a considerable and
sudden one. Within an hour of this register being
made, a fall had again occurred to 29Â·25, and even
a little below this was marked, at which point the
column remained until the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>It is clear that during the whole progress of the storm
the temperature was never very low. The great cold
came from the strength of the wind. During the storm,
and in the course of the severe days that followed, not
more than five or six degrees of frost were registered,
and on one day of the week, when there was snow on
every hand, the thermometer never rose higher than
freezing point. The wind, however, was terrific, its
maximum force during the night being 10, and 12 is the
highest possible. To this extraordinary velocity is due
the fact that the visitation is best describable by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
term "blizzard." With a less violent wind, there would
have been a great fall of snow, as great probably as that
of January, 1881, when difficulties and disasters painfully
comparable with those of the present year were spread
broadcast over not only the western portion, but the
whole of England, but it would have been a snowstorm
and not a blizzard, and many of the phenomenal aspects
of the visitation under notice would have been absent.
In the course of the present narrative many remarkable
effects due to the powdery nature of the snow will have
to be recorded. Before concluding the meteorological
portion of the subject, and getting on with the story, it
may be well to observe that according to the best
authorities a blizzard is caused by the fierceness of the
wind, which blows the cold into the vapour in the
atmosphere and consolidates it into fine snow without
allowing time for the formation of a snow-flake. We
are accustomed to associate ideas of gentleness and
beauty and stillness with the fall of snow. The blizzard,
which is apparently&mdash;but, of course, only in name&mdash;a
new acquaintance, shews us the reverse side of the
picture, and suggests nothing beyond merciless fury and
destructiveness.</p>

<p>As to the quantity of snow that fell, accounts differ.
There were huge drifts in most places; in others there
was a comparatively level covering of many feet in
thickness. The condition of a part of George Street,
Plymouth, which received a very fair quantity, is artistically
portrayed in the accompanying illustration, copied
from a photograph taken on the morning of Tuesday by
Mr. Heath, photographer, of Plymouth. According to
observations made by Dr. Merrifield, of Plymouth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
value of whose scientific researches into the mysteries of
matters meteorological are beyond question, the quantity
of snow and rain that fell between Monday evening and
early on Wednesday morning was Â·68. This was
registered at the doctor's residence, which stands 125
feet above the level of the sea, and faces S.S.E. With
the depth of snow in other places, this record will deal in
due course.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>During the whole time the blizzard was raging, the
wind varied from N.E. to S.E. The changes were very
rapid, but this was the widest range. Along the coast
the greatest severity appears to have been experienced
from a point or two eastward of Teignmouth to Falmouth
Bay, many towns exposed to the sea having to bear
their share of the burden, and unhappily many valuable
lives being lost through disastrous wrecks. If a
map of the three counties of Devon, Cornwall, and
Somerset be consulted, it will be found that, taking
this portion of the coast as an opening through which the
broad shaft of a hurricane entered, now sweeping in a
north-easterly, and now in a south-easterly direction, the
area of country that has sustained the heaviest damage will
be embraced, the intensity of the violence inflicted gradually
diminishing the further one travels towards the east,
north, and west. Dartmoor forms a kind of centre of
the chief scene of desolation, and Plymouth, being well
within the range, has suffered far more severely than any
other large town in the three counties. To the eastward,
in particular, it is clear that the effects of the gale are
not nearly so serious, though the fall of snow was pretty
abundant all over the southern part of England.   Outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of Devon and West Cornwall there are no great
lots of timber down, though here and there a fallen tree is
observable.</p>

<p>Unhappily the departure of the storm was not so
sudden as its advent. The Tuesday following the night
of tempest was an indescribably wretched day, and the
barometer fell to 29Â·180. Wednesday brought sunshine
and hope with it, and afforded the one bright spot in this
gloomy record by showing up many effects of wonderful
beauty in the snow-covered landscapes. Still the wind
was never at rest, though the thermometer went up to
120Â° in the sun. Thursday followed with more snow,
and occasional sharp and ominous squalls, and some
apprehension was felt that a repetition of Monday's
experience was in the air, but fortunately the week wore
away without further calamity, and the work of repairing
to some extent the damage done, and thereby making
existence for man and beast possible, a task hitherto
carried on under tremendous difficulties, was vigorously
pushed forward.</p>

<p>A letter, which will be found interesting, was, on the
day after the storm, written to the editor of the <i>Western
Morning News</i>, and published in that paper, by Captain
Andrew Haggard, of the King's Own Scottish Borderers,
now stationed at Devonport. The writer is a brother of
Mr. Rider Haggard, and himself a novelist of repute.
This letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The cyclonic nature of the blizzard that has
been annoying us all so much, and causing such a frightful
amount of damage during the last two days, may be
judged by the following observations taken by several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>officers in the South Raglan Barracks on the evening of
the 9th instant. From these observations it would seem
as if for a time the South Raglan Barracks were in the
exact centre of the storm, being left for varying periods
in a complete calm in consequence. Here are the notes
we made:&mdash;At 8Â·12 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the storm was raging so furiously
that the solid old Raglan was shaken to its foundations,
the fire was roaring up the chimney as if in a
blast furnace, and the noise made by the blizzard generally
was such that it was difficult to hear one's neighbour
speak. But at 8Â·13 suddenly came a complete lull. The
elements ceased to wage war, the fire assumed its normal
demeanour, and an officer who went out to see what had
happened came in and reported that it was so calm he
was able to light matches outside. For thirteen minutes
did this calm last. At 8Â·26 with a roar like thunder, the
wind returned, and once more we were dreading that the
armies of the chimney pots would fall upon us in their
fury. Only for twenty minutes, though, did the hurricane
scream and yell, and as before make itself generally
obnoxious. At 8Â·46 there was another absolute cessation
of wind until 8Â·53, when it 'blizzed' worse than before.
And shortly afterward everyone started forth to put out
fires, when all the amateur meteorologists discovered to
their grief that whatever the cyclone might do in the way
of lulling occasionally down at the Raglan, on the top of
Stoke Hill it blizzed all night with perfect impartiality.</p>

THE BLIZZARD.</h2>


<p>Soon after daylight, on the morning of Monday,
March 9th, over the whole of the West of England, the
fine weather that had prevailed for several weeks past
gave place to a most unpleasant condition of affairs.
The temperature fell, almost suddenly, and in the neighbourhood
of Plymouth, Devonport, and Stonehouse,
snow was falling fitfully from about an hour before noon.
There was a gradually rising wind, that assumed menacing
proportions as the afternoon wore on, while the snow that
had, for the first few hours, thawed as soon as it fell
upon the yet warm ground, was rapidly forming a white
covering on every position exposed to the sky. At six
o'clock, in the three towns some four or five inches of
snow lay upon the ground, and the wind had increased
to a hurricane. Slates began to start from the roofs of
houses, and chimneys to fall, and in a very short time
the streets assumed a deserted appearance, and all
vehicular traffic was stopped. Advertisement hoardings
were hurled from their positions with some terrible
crashes, and in many instances the splinters were
promptly seized by a thrifty populace and taken away
for firewood. Many trees were blown down in the early
part of the night. In Buckland Street, Plymouth, a tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of sufficient size to block the roadway fell at about eight
o'clock, and not long after another heavy tree fell from
AthenÃ¦um Garden across AthenÃ¦um Street, the main
road to the Great Western Railway Station, completely
closing the thoroughfare. Our illustration, reproduced
from a photograph taken by Mr. Heath of George Street,
Plymouth, on the morning after the storm, gives a
realistic idea of the condition of Plymouth streets, and
of the quantity of snow that was blown about during the
night.</p>

<p>On Plymouth Hoe, iron seats were blown from their
fastenings and rolled over and over, the ironwork in
many instances being curiously bent. The statue of
Drake, the Armada Memorial, and the Smeaton Tower
looked, however, none the worse for the wild night.
Perhaps, when the sun shone upon them on Wednesday
they may be described as having looked better for the
patches of glistening snow that clung to them in most
picturesque form. Strange to say, the Pavilion Pier
sustained no damage beyond a smashed pane or two of
glass. Exposed as it must have been to the full fury of
the gale, it stood the turmoil gallantly, and this fact
speaks well for the soundness of the structure, and for
the good workmanship and material used in its erection.</p>

<p>Trees were uprooted or snapped short off at Woodside,
the residence of Mr. Bewes, at Portland Square, and in
many other parts of Plymouth. Of these irreparable
losses much more will be said in the course of this
record. Concerning the damage wrought among houses
and homesteads, and the marvellous escapes from injury
to life and limb, our limited pages would not permit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the chronicling of one hundredth part of those that were
met with in the Three Towns alone during that night.
At Clifton Place, Plymouth, a chimney fell through the
roof into a bedroom occupied by three little girls, and
completely buried them, two being so badly injured as
to necessitate their removal to the hospital. In this
instance the staircase was blocked by the dÃ©bris, and
access to the terrified children could only be obtained
by means of ladders, and with the greatest difficulty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="600" height="357" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ATHENÃ†UM STREET, PLYMOUTH.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>On Mutley Plain, one of the most exposed situations
in Plymouth, the storm raged with terrific fury, women
and children being blown off their feet and half-suffocated
with the rush of snow-laden wind, while such cabmen as
had ventured abroad with their cabs, made their way
back to more sheltered quarters with great difficulty.
Numerous instances in this locality of strong men receiving
severe contusions through being blown against walls
and railings are recorded. At Alexandra Place, Mutley,
a terrific gust of wind caught one of the chimneys of the
house, sending it through the roof, and the only means
of rendering the house habitable for the time was by
stretching tarpaulins over the breach. There is no
statement accessible of the number of fallen chimneys
and damaged roofs that might have been discovered in
the Three Towns alone during that night, and even if
there were, to recount them all would only be to tell one
sad story over and over again with wearisome monotony;
but it is probably safe to say that scarcely one street in
the whole of the district escaped without some house
receiving injury. Fortunately the storm was at its height
at about 8 o'clock in the evening, an hour when bedrooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
are usually unoccupied. Had the chief fury of
the gale been spent some hours later, it is more than
likely that numerous fatalities would have had to be
recounted.</p>

<p>At a shop in Fore Street, Devonport, a similar accident
occurred, two children while lying in bed being badly
crushed through a chimney falling. At the Main Guard,
at the top of Devonport Hill, the windows were blown
in, but the soldiers on duty fortunately escaped without
injury, and were removed into the barracks. The
roofs of the "Crown and Column," and of the wine and
spirit store in the occupation of Messrs. Chubb &amp; Co., both
in Devonport, were seriously injured, while at Wingfield
Villa, Stoke, the residence of the rector of Stoke Damerel,
soon after 8 o'clock, a terrific squall burst upon the house
and sent a large chimney stack crashing through the
roof into the drawing room, doing great damage to some valuable
furniture. Altogether, a lengthy chapter of
accidents might be recorded as the result of the gale on
Monday evening in Devonport. In a few instances
personal injuries of a more or less serious nature were
sustained, but it is not a little remarkable, that here, as
elsewhere in the immediate neighbourhood, while there
were many narrow escapes no case of a fatal character
occurred.</p>

<p>Among other narrow escapes at Devonport may be
instanced that of a gentleman living in Albert Road,
Morice Town. He went to a back bedroom on the top
storey to nail up a board to prevent smoke from blowing
down the chimney, when a sudden gust struck the
stack and precipitated it on to the roof, which fell through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the ceiling into the bedroom, burying him and carrying a
portion of the floor into the back drawing-room below.
The gentleman in question managed to extricate himself
from the dÃ©bris, and escaped with a severe shaking. In
another case, a family occupying two rooms at the top of
an old house in Cannon Street, nearly lost their lives.
The occupier, his wife, and mother-in-law, were sitting
around the bedroom fire when the roof fell on them.
Their injuries were not of a serious character, but considerable
damage was done to their furniture. It is
estimated that about Â£50 worth of damage was done to
the buildings at the back of Hope (Baptist) Chapel in
Fore Street; a chimney falling bodily crashed through the
roof, and carried one of the class-rooms and the gallery of
the Sunday-school into the vestry. A chimney stack falling
from No. 7, Chapel Street, destroyed a conservatory,
and did considerable damage to the roof of the adjoining
house, No. 6. A large portion of the roof of the South
Devon Sanitary Laundry, Cornwall Street, was blown
away, and the work of the establishment was temporarily
disarranged in consequence. Extensive damage was also
done to property at 10, Stopford-place, Stoke.</p>

<p>One of the most miraculous escapes that occurred was
that at the residence of Mr. Perkins (Lord Mount-Edgecumbe's
surveyor) in Emma Place, Stonehouse. During
the hurricane Mrs. Perkins heard the windows and doors
rattling, and rushed up to the nursery to see that the
windows were closed and doors fastened. The servant
was closing the window, her mistress standing near the
chimney breast, when there was a sudden crash. The
servant clung to the framework of the window, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Mrs. Perkins immediately found herself buried in bricks
and mortar. She was sitting on a portion of the floor near
the window, with her legs dangling over an abyss; the
floors having been carried away, with the exception of
two floor boards, upon which, happily, she had been deposited.
The snow found its way into the house, and
although no one could distinguish her or the servant,
she seems to have grasped the situation and called to
her husband to bring a ladder to release her and the
girl. This eventually was done, but the intense excitement
of the moment may be well imagined. Mr.
Perkins, having obtained a ladder and a light had
the greatest difficulty in discovering the position of those
above, but having done so, he released both from their
perilous position, little thinking that the ladder was
resting on fallen rubbish, the slightest shock to which
would have precipitated all to the basement.</p>

<p>During this night of disaster, probably the most
calamitous incident that occurred on land, was a fire
which broke out at about 8 o'clock at 4, Wingfield
Villas, Stoke, the residence of Mr. Venning, Town
Clerk of Devonport, and which resulted in the total
destruction of the house and its contents, as well as
in material damage to the adjoining villa. A chimney-stack
facing the direction from which the wind blew
gave way and, crashing through the roof of the nursery,
carried with it a quantity of dÃ©bris through the floor of
the nursery into the drawing-room below. Through the
aperture thus made the fire from the nursery grate,
and it is supposed also a lamp, were carried, and
speedily ignited the contents of the drawing-room. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fire, being fanned by the fierce gale, just then at its
height, increased rapidly, and the premises were soon in
a blaze.</p>

<p>Owing to the elevated position in which the
house stood the conflagration was visible at a great
distance, and in spite of the weather, large numbers of
people visited the spot, although the journey thither,
under the circumstances, was one of the most difficult
it is possible to conceive. To those who ventured on
the walk, however, the sight presented was an extraordinarily
impressive one. The flames raged like the
blast of a furnace, and the mingling of smoke, sparks
and snow-dust produced an effect that was as novel as it
was terrible. Sparks from the burning building were
carried immense distances, and beaten, with the snow-powder,
against the windows of houses that faced the
burning villa. Standing at a distance of nearly a mile,
with eyes fixed on the blaze, it was impossible to believe
that the roar of the fire could not be heard, so nearly
did the howling and surging of the wind resemble the
roar caused by a great volume of rushing flame.</p>

<p>In connection with the fire several narrow escapes are
recorded. Mr. Venning's daughter, about six years of age,
had a perilous experience. She had been put to bed by
her nurse, and, during the absence of the latter from the
room for a few minutes, the chimney clashed through
the roof into the drawing-room. Fortunately Mr.
Venning's daughter received nothing worse than a severe
fright, and she was quickly removed to a neighbouring
house. The ladies who were in the drawing-room at the
time of the crash were also greatly alarmed, and made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hasty exit from the building, being hospitably sheltered
at Wingfield House by Colonel Goodeve, <span class="smcap">R.A.</span>, and also
at the house of a relative, in Godolphin Terrace.</p>

<p>The efforts of the firemen to prevent the spread of the
flames, under circumstances of great difficulty, were
crowned with a well-merited success. Water was not
readily available, and when obtained was not abundant,
but notwithstanding this a gallant fight was made, and
although to save the one dwelling was impossible, the
contents of the adjoining one were safely removed, and
the structure itself was snatched from total demolition.
In addition to the West of England and Devonport Fire
Brigades, and a large staff of constables under the
charge of Mr. Evans, the Chief Constable of Devonport,
there were present Colonel Liardet, <span class="smcap">R.M.L.I.</span>, the field
officer of the day, and a detachment of men belonging to
the King's Own Scottish Borderers, under Captain
Haggard. Several manual engines from the troops in
garrison were taken to the scene of the fire, but, with
one exception, they were not brought into use. A
number of civilians were conspicuous for their energy
in performing voluntary salvage duty. The damage
resulting from this fire has been estimated at something
like Â£7,000.</p>

<p>On their way to and from the scene of the fire by way
of Millbridge, many pedestrians from Plymouth had
narrow escapes from being blown over the parapet of
the bridge into the Deadlake. About half-past eight,
when the fire had somewhat abated, the majority of the
Plymouth spectators moved back with the intention of
re-crossing the bridge, but the wind had increased in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
violence, and the water in the lake was so disturbed that
the waves could be heard lashing against the bridge and
on the shores. Some who ventured on the bridge were
driven back, and consternation began to spread among
the crowd, many women screaming loudly. To proceed
to Plymouth by way of Pennycomequick was also a
matter of difficulty, as the full fury of the gale blowing
down the valley had to be faced. Many waited on the
Devonport side until there was a lull, when some of
them linked their arms in those of their friends for
safety's sake and so crossed to Plymouth.</p>

<p>During the whole of Monday night Her Majesty's
vessels in the Hamoaze were in positions of great peril,
and those holding responsible posts in connection with
them underwent great anxiety. The <i>Lion</i> and <i>Implacable</i>,
anchored just above Torpoint, which form an
establishment for training boys, under the command of
Commander Morrison, dragged their moorings during
the evening.   The vessels were moored stern to stern,
and connected by a covered gangway.   The cause of
the mishap was the parting of the starboard bridle of the
<i>Implacable</i>.   At about half-past nine signals of distress
were made to the shore, and it was stated that the two
ships had been driven ashore, and were in the mud off
Thanckes. This, however, proved not to be the case,
as the vessels never even touched the ground.   As soon
as the danger was known all available tugs at Devonport
Dockyard were despatched with a view to taking off, if
necessary, the hundreds of boys who were on board.
At midnight, however, all apprehension for the safety of
the vessels had been practically removed, although as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the storm had by no means abated, the tugs were
ordered to stand by all night in order to give any
assistance that might be required.</p>

<p>In the meantime there was great excitement in Sutton
Harbour. Between eight and nine o'clock several of the
trading vessels, trawlers, and fishing craft lying at anchor
began to drag, and extra warps had to be got out, and the
vessels secured. The sea in the harbour was very heavy,
and at one time some fear was felt for the buildings along
the quay, but no damage of this nature occurred. Some
of the stores along the North quay were roughly handled
by the wind, the roof of the new coal store of Messrs.
Hill and Co. was blown off, and a similar accident
occurred to the premises in the occupation of Messrs.
Vodden and Johns, but generally speaking the damage
on the quays was satisfactorily light. A good deal of
anxiety was expressed as to the welfare of trawlers who
were known to be in the channel, and, as a subsequent
chapter will show, these fears were by no means groundless.
The cutter of the harbourmaster, lying in
Plymouth Sound was reported to be in a sinking
condition during the night, and a tug was sent to her
assistance. She had four men on board, who were
removed for safety, but ultimately the cutter weathered
the storm, and is still afloat.</p>

<p>Under conditions like these the night of the ninth of
March wore away in the Three Towns. To many the
night was a long one, and crowded with all sorts of
apprehensions. The wind, never for a moment silent,
rose again and again to hurricane force, and the fine
snow so swiftly covered the window panes that to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
out upon the night soon became a matter of difficulty.
There was no great feeling of security indoors, but to
remain out for long was a matter of impossibility, and
the imperfect and disconnected rumours of disaster that
were disseminated created all the more alarm from the
fact that they could not be investigated. Hundreds of
households did not go to bed at all, while very many sat
up all night because their bedrooms were in a state of
hopeless confusion, or of absolute wreck. Some were
without fire, through a defect having been brought about
in the chimney, or through the chimney having fallen in
altogether; and in those localities where the buildings
were of the dilapidated or frail order the wretchedness
for the night, and, indeed, for the week throughout, was
very great.</p>

<p>Not the least serious part of the gale was the number
of friends missing from the Plymouth district. Quite
early there was a breakdown of the telegraph wires,
which made all telegraphic communication with other
parts of the country impossible, and the late arrival of
many trains into the west, and the non-arrival of others,
led to much anxious conjecture as to the fate of those
whose appearance in Plymouth during the night had
been confidently expected. The first indications of
telegraphic interruption were observed as early as half-past
four on Monday afternoon, when communication
with Tavistock was suspended. Following this, the
reports of breakdowns from all parts of the two counties
became very frequent until about seven o'clock, when
communication with London and all places above
Plymouth ceased.   Penzance, and one or two Cornish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
towns could be communicated with for some time
longer, but soon all operations were suspended, and no
messages were received at the Plymouth office after
eight o'clock. As a general rule the breakdown was
caused by trees falling across the wires, or by the
telegraph posts having been brought bodily to the
ground. As will be subsequently seen, this condition of
things prevailed to a great extent, and in some cases the
telegraph wires and posts got upon the railway lines and
prevented the progress of the trains.</p>

<p>The interruption of the local train service commenced
early on Monday. Trains due at North Road Station,
Plymouth, between mid-day and eight o'clock in the
evening were all considerably behind time, and the telegraphic
and telephonic instruments being rendered useless,
thus making communication with other stations impossible,
the officials had an anxious period of waiting for information
of belated trains. At about nine o'clock the
"Jubilee," which left London at one o'clock, and should
have reached North Road, Plymouth, at 7Â·30, came into the
station. With the remarkable experiences of passengers
by this, one of the last trains that reached Plymouth by
either the London and South Western or Great Western
lines from Monday night to Saturday, and other trains
that failed to reach Plymouth at all, a subsequent
chapter will deal, should space permit. A train from
Tavistock, due at 8Â·40, did not appear until eleven
o'clock, and the eight o'clock train from Launceston
did not come at all. The "Alexandra," a train that
left Waterloo Station at 2Â·40 arrived at nine o'clock,
the driver stating that near Okehampton he had to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
through three feet of snow. These, however, are the
trains that did arrive. There were many that did not,
and in many scores of instances a member of a family
was not heard of for days, although, happily, in the
majority of cases, the missing one ultimately turned up
with nothing worse than a severe cold and a great
distaste for winter life in small Devonshire or Cornish
towns.</p>

<p>So far the state of affairs in the Three Towns only has
been dealt with, but it will be readily surmised that adjacent
towns, and more especially those in the neighbourhood
of Dartmoor, and the more open parts of
Cornwall, suffered very considerably. Generally speaking,
the damage to house property was nowhere so great as
in Plymouth and Devonport. In the country districts,
as a matter of course, calamities of a most serious and
special character were met with, and trees were felled,
sheep buried, and oxen frozen in enormous quantities,&mdash;in
some instances, also, human life was sacrificed, but in
none of the other larger towns was the devastation so
widespread as in the Three Towns. At Exeter, the fall
of snow was said to be the heaviest for years, and by
reason of its suddenness, even more severe than the
storm of 1881. The drifts of snow in some places were
of great depth. As at Plymouth, traffic as well as
business was suspended, but there were no serious mishaps,
the force of the wind, though great, being evidently
not so fierce as was the case further west. Railway communication
between Exeter and Plymouth was of course
impossible, but there were on Tuesday four trains trying
to run between Exeter and Taunton.   The North of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
England mail, which should have arrived at Exeter at
half-past eight was four hours late, but it did put in an
appearance. The trains of the London and South
Western Railway ran to Exeter from the North just as
usual, throughout the week.</p>

<p>At Torquay the storm was the severest experienced
there for many years. There was a heavy fall of snow
on the night of Monday, and on the following morning
the ground was covered to the depth of a foot. A
strong easterly wind was also blowing, and trees were
uprooted in every part of the district. At the Recreation
Grounds the roof was blown off the grand stand,
and a huge tree blew across the railway at Lowes
Bridge, near Torre Station. An engine of the up-train
cut through this and traffic was suspended until the line
was cleared by a breakdown gang on Tuesday. The
trains from London and Plymouth failing to run,
Torquay soon became isolated, and telegraph and telephone
communication was early interfered with in consequence
of the poles being blown down and the wires
broken by the burden of snow. Considerable damage
was done to the New Pier works by the heavy gale.
Plant for moulding the concrete was washed away, as
was also a portion of the masonry, while parts of the
sea-wall were damaged, and a flight of stone steps leading
to the sea-wall were swept completely away. Street
traffic was so much impeded by the snow that on the
Tuesday after the storm the Town Surveyor constructed
a wooden snow-plough, and with this, drawn by two
horses, the roads were cleared. All the public clocks in
the town were stopped by the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Tavistock was one of the towns that had the severest
experiences. The barometer fell rapidly on Monday
morning, and at about eleven o'clock snow began to fall;
while, as the day advanced, it was accompanied by a
high wind, that, towards seven o'clock in the evening,
increased to a hurricane. In Tavistock, and all along
the Tavy Valley, the full force of the storm was felt, large
trees being uprooted, houses unroofed, and chimney-stacks
blown down in every direction. One of the latter
instances occurred in West Street, where the occupant, a
lady, had been suffering from a serious illness. The
chimney-stack being blown over, the dÃ©bris fell through
the roof into the bedroom where the invalid was lying.
Her attendant received some cuts on the head, but the
invalid escaped the falling masonry, although she received
a severe shock to the system through the incident.
A waggoner employed at the Ph&oelig;nix Mills, Horrabridge,
was returning to Tavistock from Lifton on Monday night,
in charge of an empty waggon and three horses, and
when within two miles of his destination, found that
through the violence of the storm he was unable to
continue his journey. He took the horses out of the
waggon, and made an ineffectual attempt to drive them
home. Failing in this the waggoner walked into
Tavistock, and at about ten o'clock returned to the spot
where he had left his horses. By this time the snow was
so deep that the horses could not be seen, and it was
necessary to leave them until the following morning.
Eventually they were dug out, and driven home, not
much the worse, to all appearance, for their night in the
snow. Tavistock being an important market town, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the centre of a large district, experienced great inconvenience
through the interruption in railway traffic,
and the impassable state of the roads. Wednesday,
March 11th, was the monthly cattle fair day, but not a
single animal was brought in. At the Fitzford Church
the window was blown in. Like many other towns in
the Dartmoor vicinity, Tavistock received more than
one disastrous visitation during this memorable week,
and its record of lost sheep and cattle, to which more
extended reference will be made further on, is a very
serious one.</p>

<p>At Bideford, and in the surrounding country, the
weather was more severe than any experienced since the
winter of 1881. The barometer had been steadily going
back all day on Sunday, and on Monday a cutting east
wind blew with considerable force. Snow commenced
falling at noon, and continued until the evening, when the
streets and roads were covered to some depth. Then the
wind rose to half a gale, whirling the snow into little
clouds, which filled both doors and windows. All through
the night the wind increased in force, until it blew a perfect
hurricane. Icicles hung inches long from windowsills
and launders of the houses. In the country, traffic
was completely suspended, the snowdrifts being as high
as the hedges. Farmers were consequently unable to
get into market, and provisions went up considerably
in price. The mail coach started for Clovelly and Hartland
as usual on Tuesday morning, and managed to reach
Clovelly. There, however, the horses had to be taken
out, and the driver rode through the deep drifts to Hartland
on horseback. The return journey was performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by another man in a similar way. All the mails were
delayed, and rural postmen's districts were mostly impassable.</p>

<p>At Teignmouth, Exmouth, Dawlish, and most other
seaside places from the estuary of the Exe to the Start,
the effects of the gale were severely felt on Monday
night. At the former place the sea ran high, and the
breakers fell with great force close to the landwash and
over the promenade. Opposite Den House the roadway
was undermined and washed away, and had it not been
for the fact that an hitherto existing stone wall lay buried
beneath the surface, which acted as a breakwater against
the heavy sea, it is almost certain that Den House and
Bella Vista would have been washed away. As soon as
the tide ebbed, the wind veered towards the northward,
and the sea went down. A gang of men were at once set
to work to shore up the embankment, and fill in the cavity
made by the sea. The Promenade towards the East Cliff
was also washed up in several places. In the Exeter
Road and at Brimley a large number of trees were blown
down, and traffic was generally suspended.</p>

<p>An illustration from a photograph by Messrs. G. Denney
&amp; Co., photographers, of Exeter and Teignmouth, portrays
one of the scenes in Exeter Road, which was
impassable for a day or two.</p>

<p>At Totnes, Brent, and in fact every town in Devonshire,
damage of a more or less severe character was
sustained. Space will not allow of a separate reference
to each locality in the present chapter, but in dealing
with occurrences that took place after the early force of
the blizzard had been exhausted on that memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Monday night and Tuesday morning, there will be found
few districts that necessity will not compel us to bring
under notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Reference has already been made to some towns in the
North of Devon. Throughout the whole of this district
the storm raged furiously, rendering communication with
many parts impossible. Although snow did not commence
to fall until Monday afternoon, by the evening of
that day the drifts had reached a depth of several feet.
The train which left Barnstaple for Ilfracombe at about
half-past eight on Monday evening became embedded
just below Morthoe station. At Ilfracombe a strong gale
raged throughout Monday night, and the brigantine
<i>Ethel</i>, of Salcombe, 180 tons went ashore at Combemartin,
but in this instance no lives were lost, the crew having
taken to their boats. In North Cornwall, a terrible snowstorm
raged for twenty-four hours, resembling in many
respects the great storm of the 18th and 19th January,
1881. The atmospheric pressure was about the same as
then, and the storm burst from the same point. On the
first day of the great storm in 1881, the temperature
varied from 26 to 30 and on the second from 25 to 30.
On the 9th of March in the present year it varied from
29 to 31&frac12;. The roads were soon blocked in all directions,
trains on the lines ceased running, and no mails
could be sent or received. Bude was cut off from the
outside world, except by telegraphic communication. In
the roads around Bude the snow was quickly as high as
the hedges, so that traffic, even on foot, was rendered
impracticable. Falmouth, Liskeard, Camborne, and
indeed all other Cornish towns, had a rough night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and before our story is finished, like many towns in
Devonshire, they will be found to have suffered
severely. To approach them with any hope of successfully
relating how they all fared on the night of Monday
and on the Tuesday following, we must deal with the
railways, for from railway travellers who were detained in
certain places on the course of their journeys, and from
the energetic officials who after heavy and anxious toil
succeeded in releasing them, many of the most thrilling
narratives have been obtained.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

ON THE RAILWAYS.</h2>


<p>Some incidents in connection with the suspension of
the railway service on every line connecting Plymouth
with the rest of the world have already been related. It
is unnecessary to dwell at further length on the terrible
mental and physical suffering entailed by this state of
things. Facts need no comment that tell of passengers
being snowed up in a train for thirty-six hours on a
stretch, and others being unable to communicate with
their friends for nearly a week, to say nothing of all that
the engine-drivers and other officials had to endure.</p>

<p>One of the first expeditions that set out into the
dreary night in search of the cause of delay was undertaken
by Mr. C. E. Compton, the divisional superintendent
of the Great Western Railway Co., and other
gentlemen, who went out on a pilot engine as far as
Camel's Head Bridge between eight and nine o'clock on
Monday night. The cause of the interruption in the
telegraph system was here ascertained, the poles being
blown down and lying across the line. Later in the
evening Mr. Compton pushed on as far as Hemerdon, on
the main line, where a similar state of things was
encountered, and it was learned that at Kingsbridge Road
and at Brent Station the snow had drifted to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
extent as to block the line. A train due from Penzance
was known to be somewhere on the Plymouth side of
Truro, but its exact whereabouts could not be discovered.
There was some anxious looking out for the
"Zulu" express from Paddington, due at Plymouth early
in the evening, but the train was at Brent, with about ten
feet of snow on the line, between it and Plymouth, and,
as will be presently seen, the passengers were meeting
with some novel and undesirable experiences.</p>

<p>The mail train from Plymouth for London left Millbay
Station at the usual time, 8Â·20, and Hemerdon Junction
was reached with much difficulty. Here the first deep
cutting had to be encountered, and the driver, approaching
it at a reduced speed, observed that the drifting
snow had practically blocked the entrance. The
seriousness of the situation was realized by one and all
of the passengers, and, although there was an anxiety
on their part to get to their destination as soon as
possible, they agreed that there was no alternative
but to either remain where they were or return to
Plymouth. The latter course was decided upon, and
shunting was at once proceeded with. The drifts of
snow rendered this work very difficult, and the frequent
jerkings caused the passengers much inconvenience.
Eventually the driver, after most skilful handling of the
locomotive, succeeded in reversing the position of the
engine, and a start was made for Plymouth. Much to
the relief of the passengers, the latter place was reached,
after a slow but sure journey, about half-past one next
morning. The utmost consideration was shown the
passengers by the station officials, and accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was found them for the night at the "Duke of Cornwall"
Hotel and in the station waiting-room.</p>

<p>All traffic on the London and South Western Railway
below Okehampton ceased soon after eight o'clock on
Monday night.   One of the slow passenger trains from
Okehampton was snowed up in a deep cutting between
Meldon Viaduct and Bridestowe, one of the bleakest
spots on the South Western system. The express
due at North Road Station at 11Â·4 on the same
night was stopped at Okehampton. The ordinary
seven o'clock up-train was despatched on Tuesday
morning from Mutley Station, and was drawn by three
engines. Considerable danger attended railway travelling
in consequence of the jolting and straining that occurred
when the numerous obstructions were met with. All the
points at the Tavistock Station were completely choked,
and though for some hours a number of men were
employed in an effort to keep them clear, the task was
found impossible, and as a result the train that might
have proceeded in the direction of Plymouth remained
where it was as the engine could not be shunted to the
Plymouth end of the train. The last up South Western
train on Monday night was snowed up at Lidford, but
the passengers were released. One of the vans of a
goods train proceeding to Tavistock early on Monday
evening was blown away.</p>

<p>Serious as was the condition of things on all the railways
on Monday night, on Tuesday matters became
worse. During that day only two trains reached Millbay
Station, Plymouth, and these, which came from Cornwall,
should have arrived on Monday night. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
account, of experiences as unique as they were unpleasant,
is thus given by the <i>Western Daily Mercury</i>:&mdash;"The
mail train from Cornwall, due at Plymouth at 8Â·10
on Monday night, reached Millbay at 9Â·30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, bringing
some eighty passengers; amongst whom were Mr. Bolitho,
banker, of Penzance, and Mrs. Bolitho, who were wishful
of getting to Ivybridge to attend the hunt, and Mr. J. H.
Hamblyn, of Buckfastleigh, who was <i>en route</i> from Liskeard
to Bristol Fair. All went well with the mail until
St. Germans was reached at about 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> It was found
that no further progress was possible, and that there was
no help for it but to pass the night in the carriages under
the shelter of the station. Mr. Gibbons, one of the
assistant-engineers of the line, and Inspector Scantlebury,
who were travelling in the train, resolved to walk to
Saltash. The snow was not so very deep at this time,
and the block was due principally to the wholesale
destruction of telegraph poles. After a rough time of it
the two officials reached Saltash, and afterwards pushed
on to Camel's Head, where was the biggest block of all,
fir trees and telegraph poles and wires being scattered
about broadcast. Meanwhile at St. Germans the station-master
(Mr. Priest) was doing his best to make the passengers
as comfortable as possible. In fact, all of those
who reached Plymouth after the night's adventure are
loud in their praises of Mr. Priest. Messengers were
despatched by him to the village, and loaves, butter, tea,
and coffee were speedily bought up. At the station fires
were lit in all the available grates, and very soon the
passengers were in possession of hot tea and coffee, as
well as bread and butter. This modest fare was repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at intervals during the night, and it goes without saying
was most welcome.</p>

<p>"After spending something like ten hours at St. Germans
the mail was able to leave at eight o'clock on
Tuesday morning for Saltash, but here another delay of
nearly two hours took place, in consequence of the block
on the Devonport side of the Camel's Head bridge. To
remove this a breakdown train had been sent out from
Plymouth at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> in charge of Mr. H. Quigley, the
assistant divisional-superintendent. This train got as far
as Keyham Viaduct without much interruption. Here
an array of prostrate poles and fir-trees required removing,
and then the breakdown train forged ahead slowly
to the Weston Mills Viaduct, where there was a confused
mass of poles and wires stretching from one side of the
creek to the other. This accomplished, a move was
made to Saltash, where the mail was met and safely
escorted to Plymouth, which all were glad to reach, after
a novel but most unpleasant night's adventure."</p>

<p>The difficulty that beset those that attempted to travel
by road the above view indicates, and is from a photograph
by A. Leamon, Esq., of Liskeard.</p>

<p>One of the passengers in the train snowed up
between Princetown and Plymouth in the evening
mail has related the following experiences:&mdash;"We left
Princetown at 6Â·30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Monday&mdash;the regular time&mdash;with
five bags of mails. The snow beat in our compartment
through closed doors, ventilators, and windows
so much, that in a few minutes I had two inches
of snow on my umbrella. We stuffed paper, handkerchiefs,
and cloth into every hole or crevice we could find,
and this remedied matters a little. The coach we were
in was a composite one&mdash;of four third-class compartments,
one second class, one first class, and one guard's,
and we were all in one compartment. Well, the wind
was blowing great guns, and we passed through two
large drifts just after leaving Princetown, but it required
some heavy pulling. We had just been congratulating
ourselves on having been lucky in getting so nicely
through the storm, when we suddenly stopped, and we
knew we had stuck in the snow. The engine driver
came and said, 'I was afraid of it; we have got over a
bar, and we cannot go on. We ought not to have
started.' The ladies became alarmed, and with that the
driver, fireman, and guard went to the front of the train
with shovels to try and dig a way for her, but it was no
good. It is true that the place where we stopped is on
a bit of decline, but the engine was choked with snow.
The guard, having told us that we could not get on
without assistance, proceeded in the direction of Dousland
to get help. He had been gone about an hour,
when he returned with the mournful intelligence that he
had lost his way, and that it was no use for him to
attempt to reach Dousland, as the snow blinded him.
We decided to make ourselves as comfortable as we
possibly could under the painful conditions to which we
were subjected&mdash;six men and two ladies huddled together
in one compartment&mdash;the cold being most bitter, and
none of us having anything to eat or drink. We lived
the night through, but in what way I can hardly tell.</p>

<p>"In the morning the wind was blowing as strong as
ever, and the snow as it fell melted on the window panes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and the lamp&mdash;our only light&mdash;was extinguished at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
Just at this time the guard and fireman left us, saying
they were going to try and reach Dousland with the
'staff,' so as to let them know of the disaster, and see
what help could be rendered. It is true that the fireman
was lame, but I understand they had fearful trouble,
as he was sadly knocked up and his foot badly lacerated.
Some little time afterwards the driver, who has, I believe,
been seriously ill, announced his intention of going to
Dousland. We then felt in a particularly sad condition,
feeling our only hope was gone now that the driver had
abandoned us. The storm was raging as fiercely as on
the previous night, but at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> we were agreeably surprised
to find three packers, who had tramped up from
Dousland with refreshments for us, knock at our door.
We were heartily glad to receive the refreshments, which,
I believe, were sent from the railway company to us in
our forlorn position&mdash;although it only consisted of cocoa,
bread and butter, and cake, with a bottle of well-watered
brandy to follow. We found there was enough for us to
have one piece of bread and butter and one piece of
cake each. This was not a very substantial bill of fare
for people who had had nothing to eat for over twenty
hours, but we were thankful for small mercies. There
is one thing I forgot: the packers were very kind, and
brought us out the guard's lamp from his van, which we
afterwards lit. One of the party, I think Palk, asked if
the packer thought we could weather the journey back.
The packer replied, 'It will take you about two hours.'
This was enough for Palk, who said he thought he was
better where he was. Besides, we asked him to stay and
not desert us in the time of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"We then awaited the result of events. The wind
was fearful, and we were all bitterly cold. We were
nearly dead in the afternoon, and drank all the brandy
by eight o'clock. If it had not been for that some of us
would have given way. The weather was milder after
midnight. About seven o'clock this morning one of us
looking out of the window saw Mr. Hilson, of Horsford,
farmer, whose farm is only about 250 yards from where
our train was lying, picking sheep out of the snow. We
whistled to him, and on his coming to us he was told of
our predicament. He expressed his astonishment that
he knew nothing of the accident. We do not see how
he could have, because the snow had been so blinding
in character until that day that it was impossible to see
anyone ahead. He offered us the use of his farm, and
we joyfully accepted the same, leaving the train after
being in her for 36 hours. Poor Mrs. Watts was much
distressed and we had to assist her down. We had
breakfast at Mr. Hilson's, and then four of us&mdash;Hancock,
Viggers, Palk and Worth&mdash;started to walk to Dousland,
which we could see ahead of us. We got on fairly well
over the snow, which was very deep in some places. We
could not keep our eyes open owing to the snow when
we left Princetown, and when we asked the station-master
for tickets he said, 'You can have them, but I
cannot promise you will get there.' It did not strike me
at the time, but if a station-master had any doubts as to
the safety or otherwise of a train he should not allow the
train to travel. It is true the wind was in our favour
when we started. Mrs. Watts is very bad indeed, and
also the engine-driver and stoker.   The engine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
train when we left was completely covered with snow,
and the snow had drifted as high as the carriage, with a
blank space between the body and the wheels. All the
compartments into which I looked before I left her&mdash;although
the windows and ventilators were closed and
doors locked&mdash;were full of snow above the hat-racks.
It was the most horrible experience of my life."</p>

<div class="caption">EXPRESS TRAIN, G. W. RY., TEIGNMOUTH.</div>
</div>

<p>Great anxiety was felt in Exeter and Plymouth on
account of the sea wall which carries the line of the
Great Western Railway Company from Dawlish to
Teignmouth. In past years this piece of line has suffered
very severely, and rumours were in circulation that it had
been washed away in some places.   Happily, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it was found, as soon as communication became opened
up once more, that the line remained intact, the damaged
portion of the sea wall being a carriage-drive close to
the town. One of our views, from a photograph by
Messrs. Denney &amp; Co., photographers, of Exeter and
Teignmouth, gives an admirable idea of the force of the
sea in this district, during the progress of a gale from the
south-east.</p>

<p>Difficulties and dangers on all the lines of railway
multiplied as time went on, and the horrors of the
Monday night, of which the foregoing narratives present
only a partial view, were succeeded by some sad instances
of loss of life, besides great damage to the property of
the respective companies, and as a matter of course, a
heavy falling off in their traffic returns. The returns for
the week, following March 9th, on the Great Western
system, showed a decrease of Â£12,980 as compared
with the corresponding week of the previous year, and
the South-Western Railway's decrease amounted to
Â£3,662&mdash;all but Â£650 of which was lost from the non-conveyance
of passengers and parcels. This was regarded
as especially unfortunate in the case of the
South-Western Railway, as its traffic returns had previously
been going up week by week, and in the eleven
weeks of the year had increased by Â£12,120, as compared
with the first eleven weeks of 1890. In addition
to these losses heavy expenses were incurred by all the
companies by the efforts made to clear away the snow,
by means of snow ploughs, and the employment of large
gangs of men. The inadequacy of the snow ploughs,
which dated in England from the time of the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
snow-fall in the early part of 1881, for clearing away
heavy drifts, has been generally admitted. The ploughs
are quite competent to get rid of from 4 to 5 feet of
snow, but their capacity is not equal to depths ranging
as high as 18 feet, such as were dealt with in some
places between Newton Abbott and Plymouth, on the
Great Western system, to say nothing of other sections
and branches. The ploughs, which are kept at
Swindon, have an iron ram in front, projecting like
that of an ironclad, with a "cutter." The attention of
engineers has, however, been now directed to a new
kind of machine, with a revolving, spade-like apparatus,
having a powerful shaft, and a propeller that is designed
to scatter the snow with which it is brought into contact,
and throw it clear of the rails on which the engine is
travelling. The work of cutting out engines that had
been absolutely embedded was very arduous, and in
one case, lamentable loss of life accompanied the other
misfortunes brought about by the storm.</p>

<p>One or two instances of striking and unprecedented
experiences of the night of Monday must be recorded
before this part of the subject, which is, in itself, enough
to fill a volume, is dismissed.</p>

<p>Passengers by the train which left Queen Street Station,
Exeter, on Monday evening at 6Â·38, and was in connection
with the 2Â·20 from Waterloo, had an exceptionally
rough time. The train, a slow one, had to make its way
across Dartmoor from Okehampton to Tavistock, and
on starting, the guard, Mr. Moore, had orders to proceed
as far as he could. After cutting through the snow for
some miles the train reached Okehampton, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
attempted to brave the force of the storm that was
sweeping down from the Dartmoor hills. It got over the
Meldon Viaduct safely, and then it was attempted to go
on over Sourton Down, but in going through Youlditch
cutting it ran into a snow-drift, and about three miles
to the west of Okehampton it was brought to a stop.
Efforts were made to run back to Okehampton, but the
rapid drifts of snow, which were from ten to twenty feet
in height, prevented this being done, and it was soon
seen that there was nothing left but to remain until help
of some kind could be obtained. There were only eleven
passengers, including two ladies and two children. The
ladies and children, who were well supplied with wraps,
were bestowed as comfortably as circumstances would
permit in a first-class carriage, the male portion of the
party, with the guard, Mr. Moore, the driver, Mr. Bennett,
and the fireman, Mr. Oates, trying to find some warmth
in the guard's van. This, however, was a matter of
impossibility, the bitter wind and the fine snow finding
its way into the compartment, to the great discomfort of
the occupants. The engine fire was kept alight, but was
useless to impart warmth to the unfortunate party. It
was only on the following day, and just before relief
arrived, that Mr. Bennett had succeeded in getting a fire
in the van by means of boring holes in one of the engine-buckets,
filling the bucket with coal and, after much
difficulty, kindling a flame, which the draught obtained
through the holes soon increased into a most welcome
blaze. Mr. John Powlesland, auctioneer, of Bow, was
one of the belated travellers, and was especially assiduous
in his efforts to do all he could for his fellow-sufferers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>When the train first showed signs of becoming embedded,
a telegram was sent from the nearest signal-box
to Exeter for assistance, and two engines were sent
down. These approached within three-quarters of a
mile of the snowed-up train, but could not be taken
nearer on that line. They were then, with some difficulty,
shunted on the up-line, with the view of pushing
their way to the carriages in that manner, but the only
result was that they became snowed-up in their turn.</p>

<p>As day approached Mr. Moore and Mr. Oates made
their way to the Sourton Inn, which stood at no great
distance, for the purpose of obtaining food, but their
endeavour met with but slight success, the inn being also
snowed-up, and the occupants having but little in the
way of provisions that they could spare. No help
arrived until Tuesday, at mid-day, when a search-party,
headed by Mr. Prickman, the Mayor of Okehampton,
and consisting of some half-a-dozen gentlemen of that
locality, succeeded, after a difficult journey, in reaching
the train. They took with them food and liquid refreshment,
and were most heartily welcomed by the imprisoned
travellers. By this time the train was entirely
buried on one side, the engine having forced the snow
on the left side up to a height of fully twenty feet. Only
a small portion of the engine and carriages was visible,
and the scene is described as a remarkable one.</p>

<p>The travellers were at once conducted by their
rescuers to Youlditch Farm, where Mr. Gard treated
them with much kindness, and took care of the ladies
and children. The gentlemen subsequently made their
way on to Okehampton, where they were detained for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
several days. The guard, engine-driver, and fireman
were not able to leave the train until the following day,
when a breakdown gang was employed to cut a passage
for the train through the snow&mdash;a task that occupied
nearly the whole of the week.</p>

<div class="caption">SNOW DRIFT, ROBOROUGH DOWN, DARTMOOR.</div>
</div>

<p>On the Launceston branch of the Great Western Railway,
the down-train, which left Tavistock at seven
o'clock on Monday evening, remained embedded in the
snow outside Horrabridge for several days. Between the
Walkham Viaduct and Grenofen tunnel very heavy
work had to be done, a deep cutting being not only
choked by the snow, but quite a score of trees having
been blown across the rails. The accompanying illustration,
depicting a snow-drift in this locality, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
photograph by Mr. Sheath, of George-street, Plymouth,
conveys an excellent picture of the heavy masses of
snow that had accumulated on this part of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>A passenger by the train which left Penzance at 6Â·25
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Monday and arrived at Plymouth at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on
Tuesday, has supplied an interesting account of the blockage
near Grampound Road. The train, containing about a
dozen passengers, was only a quarter of a mile above Grampound
Road Station when it encountered a drift of snow
fully twenty feet high. It was impossible to proceed or
to retreat, for the blinding storm had drifted more snow
on to the line behind, so that passengers left the train
and crossed some fields back to the village, and found
shelter at the Grampound Road Hotel. It was then about
10Â·30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The guard Kelly remained on the train, and
the under-guard Hammett walked back to Grampound
Road and wired to Liskeard for a relief engine. He then
walked on to meet an engine which had been sent for
from Truro, and returned to the train on it. A relief
gang arrived from Lostwithiel under engine-driver Harris,
and the men dug at the drift until eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on Tuesday,
when the train was able to proceed. One of the
workers described the cold as so intense that the snow
froze on the men's clothes, practically encasing them in
ice, and the under-guard Hammett, who had been at the
work for over twenty years, said he never had such an
experience, and even in the terrific storm of 1881 the
snow was not so blinding.</p>

<p>Another passenger who travelled by the 6Â·50 Great
Western up-train from Plymouth on Monday returned by
a somewhat roundabout route, and he thus described his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
experiences: Hemerdon was reached without any delay
on the journey, but at that point the train was drawn
up for about three-quarters of an hour, to allow a down
train to pass. It then proceeded slowly in face of
a terrific gale, accompanied by blinding snow. After
leaving Cornwood, a grating sound on the roof of the carriage
suggested broken wires, and this was followed by a
jerk and a stoppage, and the interesting announcement
that one coach and the engine were off the rails, and
embedded in a snowdrift. There was nothing for it but
to wait, and the "wait" lasted the whole night. There
was nothing to eat for anybody, and the forty or more
passengers (amongst whom were several ladies) had to
make their night watches as comfortably as was possible
under the circumstances in the Langham cutting! It
seems that the driver and one of the guards succeeded
in reaching Ivybridge, about a mile away, in the late
evening, but no notice of the proximity of the village was
given to the passengers. On Tuesday morning a small
party from Ivybridge, under Messrs. Brown and Greenhough,
two engineers superintending the alterations to
the line in the neighbourhood, came to the rescue of all
who were willing to face the blinding storm. Only four
consented to go, and they were very thankful to exchange
the cold comfort of the railway carriage for the hearty
hospitality offered by these gentlemen in Ivybridge.</p>

<p>The officials here do not seem generally to have been
equal to the exigencies of the situation, no notice of
their whereabouts being given to the passengers, nor any
organised attempt made at rescue or provisioning, but a
porter and a packer from Ivybridge station arrived about
daybreak with whisky and brandy. When the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
passengers referred to were leaving at about 9Â·30 on the
Tuesday morning, bread and butter and tea were being
dispensed. Many of the remaining passengers were
hospitably accommodated by Miss Glanville at her house
close to the half-buried train, the ladies being assisted
thither by the engineers and their party. Another train
was detained at Ivybridge Station, and the passengers
from it were lodged in the village.</p>

<p>In West Cornwall three trains were snowed up. The
train which left Plymouth at five o'clock on Monday night
and should have reached Penzance at 8Â·45, arrived there
at eleven. The "Dutchman" which should have, in the
ordinary course of things, followed within fifteen minutes
of this train, did not arrive at all, and news soon reached
Penzance that the fast train was snowed up, but in what
spot was only ascertained with much difficulty. A train
was at once got ready, and on it Mr. Blair, the station-master,
Mr. Ivey, the superintendent of the locomotive
department, Mr. Glover, and a breakdown gang, proceeded
to Camborne, which was reached about noon on
Tuesday, it having taken about nine hours to accomplish
a journey of thirteen miles. All the way along huge
drifts of snow were met with, completely blocking the
passage, and at frequent intervals the way had to be
literally cut through the drifts by the men of the breakdown
gang. Thus, with great difficulty, Hayle was
reached, and from thence to Camborne the task became
almost overpowering. Here the open country favoured
the accumulation of snow, and the drifts were immense.
In a deep cutting, close to Gwinear Station, was encountered
a drift of about eighty yards long and nine
feet deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>On at length reaching Camborne it was discovered
that the missing 8Â·45 train had left Redruth at about
ten o'clock on Monday night&mdash;an hour and a half
late. The storm was then at its height, and the snow
was driving with such force that only very slight
progress could be made. The train passed Carn Brea
safely, but when within sight of Camborne Station,
close to Stray Park, the engine left the metals, running
on the south side, and finally bringing up at a hedge
against which it lay on its side. Fortunately, at the
time of the occurrence, speed was slow, and nothing more
serious than some damage to the rolling stock, and the
inconvenient detention of the twenty or thirty passengers
occurred. These included five ladies, who were taken
to the house of Mr. Maurice Reed, the Station Master at
Camborne, the gentlemen of the party having good
opportunities of finding comfortable quarters in the
hotels of the town. Another train was embedded in
fifteen feet of snow on the Helston branch line from
Gwinear Road to Helston, and the guard, engine-driver,
and stoker, with their one passenger, were compelled to
abandon the train and seek shelter in a neighbouring
farm-house.</p>

<p>While great inconvenience and discomfort was
caused by the blizzard on the Cornish railways as a
whole, no fatalities were reported, and the work of clearing
the lines, great and arduous as it was, was accomplished
in less time than in the districts above Plymouth,
and in the vicinity of Dartmoor. Communication between
Plymouth and Cornwall was opened up some
days earlier than that with Totnes, Exeter, and other
towns. The scene here depicted shows the depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
snow in this neighbourhood, and is from a photograph by
A. Leamon, Esq., of Liskeard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">MAIN ROAD BETWEEN LISKEARD AND TORPOINT.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Above Exeter things were not so bad. In the Tiverton
district the effects of the blizzard were rather severely
felt, and communication between some towns was for the
time cut off.   The railway authorities were very active,
and gangs of men were sent up from Exeter on Tuesday
to clear the lines, but they could do little more than
keep the points clear for shunting, watch the signals,
and fix detonators where required, the driving snow being
so blinding, and the coldness of the bitter wind so intense.
The difficulties of the neighbourhood commenced
on Monday evening at the Whitehall tunnel,
when the pilot, in front of the express, got off the
line.   Daylight came before a gang of packers sent from
Taunton could effect a clearance, and instead of passing
at ten o'clock on Monday night, the express only struggled
into Tiverton Junction, with two engines attached, at half-past
six on Tuesday morning.   The night mail, and the
North mail followed some hours after, and managed to get
through to Exeter, but after that, until Wednesday morning
at eleven o'clock, no train could leave the junction.</p>

<p>After being snowed up for some hours at Burlescombe,
the first part of the newspaper train reached
Tiverton at half-past ten on Tuesday night. The
train was stopped at the home signal, and so intense
was the cold that the machinery was, in a few
minutes, frozen, and the train could not enter the
station. The ladies&mdash;mostly for Plymouth&mdash;who were
in the train, were carried on chairs by porters and
packers to the adjacent Railway Hotel, where they,
and some of the male passengers, were able to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
beds for the night. The train remained in the same
position until Wednesday morning. In a siding also
stood a slow train, which should have reached Tiverton
on Tuesday at ten in the morning, but which did not
get in until the afternoon. The passengers by this train
were transferred to the first down-train that was got out
from Tiverton on Wednesday. The second part of the
newspaper train remained at Burlescombe all Monday
night. The store of provisions in the hamlet was already
exhausted, and although as much as a guinea was offered
for a bed by some of the passengers, neither food nor
sleeping accommodation could be obtained. A very
uncomfortable night was passed in consequence, and many
of the ladies suffered severely from hunger and exposure.</p>

<p>H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, on his way to Devonport,
was snow-bound at Taunton on Tuesday night, but
with about two hundred other passengers, was able to
proceed on his journey at the end of the week.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness afterwards conveyed to the
Directors of the Company his appreciation of the
courtesy and attention he received from the officials and
servants of the Great Western Railway, on his journey
during the gale and snowstorm, and during his detention
at Taunton, on March 11th and 12th, and particularly
thanked the Taunton station-master for his services.</p>

<p>At Brent, one of the most exposed railway towns on
Dartmoor, the Zulu, from London, which was due at
Plymouth at 8Â·55 on Monday night, came to grief, and a
number of passengers spent several days of that week in
this very bleak locality. Especial discomfort appears to
have prevailed here, probably on account of the difficulty
of obtaining assistance or information from any neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
town, and from the limited resources for personal
comfort that the town afforded. There can be no doubt
that the experiences of the first two days and nights
must have been wretched in the extreme. After two
hours waiting in the carriages, in a state of considerable
doubt as to what was to happen, the travellers found
themselves at length at the Brent station. Here there
was neither refreshment nor accommodation, but the
hotels of the town were made for. Quarters were difficult
to obtain, however, as a large number of contractors
men working on the new line of railway were residing in
the place. On Monday night many passengers lay upon
the floor, using their overcoats for pillows, and their rugs
for coverings. A Mr. Stumbles, a commercial traveller,
who was one of the Brent unfortunates, gave an account
of his experiences to a representative of the <i>Western
Morning News</i>, which has led to much subsequent controversy,
and to a shower of letters, conveying many
diverse opinions, being sent in to the editor of that
paper. It appears that there were about forty passengers
in the train, and that many of these remained at the
station all night, either in the train or in the waiting-room.
Next day Brent was visited, and refreshments
were bought at, as Mr. Stumbles says, famine prices.</p>

<p>The account referred to goes on to say:&mdash;"One
gentleman bought a bottle of brandy, for which he had
to pay 6<i>s.</i>, the inns charged us double price for ordinary
meals, and some establishments refused to supply us at
all, probably thinking that a famine was impending.
We returned to the station as best we could, through the
great drifts of snow, and, with such provisions as we
could buy, did the best we could, cooking such things as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
bloaters in the station waiting-room. Our scanty supply,
I must say, was most generously supplemented from the
small stores which the railway officials, such as signalmen
and others, had with them. There were a number of
sailors and soldiers amongst the passengers, and most of
them were without means. One gentleman gave them a
sovereign, and ladies from Brent also brought them
money, tobacco, and provisions during our stay. On
the following monotonous days we spent our time in
smoking and in conversation, and also in 'chaffing' the
station-master, whom we christened 'Dr. Parr.' On
Wednesday an enterprising amateur photographer from
Brent took several views of our snowed-up train, with
the eighteen or twenty passengers who stuck by it
perched in various prominent positions upon it. We
all united in praising the minor officials, and the men in
charge of the train, for remaining faithful to us, and
excused the want of sympathy of 'Dr. Parr' on account
of his age. The driver kept the fires of his engine going
all the time, but his boilers had to be filled with water
by hand, and in this work valuable assistance was readily
given by the soldiers and marines in the train. Just
before we were enabled to leave Brent, we were visited
for the first time by the clergyman of the parish, and our
final leave-taking was celebrated by three sarcastic
cheers for 'Dr. Parr' and for 'Brent.' The passengers
in this train included Lieutenant Rice, of the
Essex Regiment; Mr. R. Bayly, J.P., of Plymouth (who
succeeded in getting through to his home on Wednesday)
Miss Sykes, and a nurse who was travelling from Scarborough
to the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital,
Plymouth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>It is only fair to the station-master at Brent, and to
the residents of the town generally, to repeat that this
description has been extensively contradicted, and among
others, by Mr. Robert Bayly, of Plymouth, who was another
of the detained passengers. Mr. Stumbles, however, has
adhered to his description, and in more than one
instance his version has been supported. Among other
interesting details of the week in Brent, is the account
of the arrival of the first newspaper, a copy of the
<i>Western Morning News</i>, which was brought over from
Totnes on the Thursday morning by an adventurous
policeman, who successfully undertook the dangerous
walk. This paper was eagerly sought after, it having
been the first account of the doings in the outer world
seen since Monday, and one of the enforced sojourners
in Brent is said to have paid five shillings for the use of
the paper for one hour. The fortunate possessor of the
journal declared that he had been offered two pounds for
it, and had declined to trade.</p>

<p>At Totnes a number of passengers were detained,
among them being a reporter of the <i>Western Morning
News</i>, who went to the town on Monday to report a
meeting, and was only released on the following Friday
night. A number of passengers who left Friary Station,
Plymouth, by the 3Â·47 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> South Western train on
Thursday, were taken into Tavistock on the following
day, after having spent the night at Lydford. Instances
innumerable of the same character occurring on
the Launceston and other lines could be related, but as
their points of interest bear such a strong resemblance
to each other, it is unnecessary to proceed further with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Thursday, March 12th, was a day of very severe
weather, and the efforts of the hundreds of men working
on the various lines to clear the snow and also to release
some of the buried trains were seriously retarded. By
the end of the week, however, things were beginning to
assume their normal aspect, and the trains were running
with tolerable punctuality. The telegraph service, in a
deplorable condition of collapse throughout the week,
was restored, and the masses of accumulated correspondence
in the post offices were sent on to their
destinations. The labour of clearing the lines was as
dangerous as it was arduous, and unhappily an accident,
proving fatal to one man, occurred during the operations
on the Great Western Railway at Ivybridge. Work was
being carried on at this spot under the superintendence
of Mr. C. E. Compton, and a number of men were
engaged in getting an engine on to the line, when a train
dashed round a curve among the workmen killing one,
named William Stentiford, of Plymouth, and seriously
injuring two others. The lamentable occurrence was
purely accidental, and that this was the only fatal
occurrence during the whole of the operations of this
most trying week indicates the care that was taken by
all those engaged on the railways from the highest
officials downwards. Such an experience was never
before met with, and it was a matter of congratulation
that those in power were able to cope with the difficulties
as well as they did. No doubt some practical lessons
were learnt during the operations, and should such a
visitation unhappily occur in the West of England on
any future occasion, the experience gained during this
terrible week will not be without value.</p>

AT SEA.</h2>


<p>Sad and disastrous as were the effects of the blizzard
on land on the night of Monday, March 9th, they were
in most cases of a nature more or less reparable. At
sea, however, the case was different, and from the afternoon
of the day on which the storm commenced to the
end of the week wrecks, resulting in the loss of over fifty
lives, were strewn along the coast from Start Point to
Falmouth. In most cases, such was the fury of the gale,
but little help could be afforded from the shore.
Generally, to launch a boat or to use a rocket apparatus
was out of the question, and those on the shore, anxious
to send help to the doomed vessels, had great difficulty
in escaping from being blown into the sea. In many
instances gallant services were rendered, and all that
courage and self-sacrifice could do with the hope of
saving life was accomplished; but the time was one of no
common peril, and on the Tuesday lives were lost in full
view of the cliffs upon the rocky fringes of which the
vessels had been driven.</p>

<p>In Plymouth Sound, and the Hamoaze, well protected
as they are from the gales of winter, much damage was
done on Monday night. In addition to the accident to
the <i>Lion</i> and <i>Implacable</i>, and the critical position of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Queen's harbour-master's cutter already briefly described,
the <i>Julia</i>, a small coastguard cutter, moored inside
Drake's Island, parted her moorings during the early
hours of Tuesday morning, and went ashore on Bottle
Nose, a point eastward of Devil's Point. She was badly
knocked about, but there were no men on board at the
time. Whilst the heavy squalls were on Tuesday
morning the <i>Impregnable</i>, training-ship for boys, Captain
Harris; the <i>Cambridge</i>, gunnery school ship, Captain
Carr, and the <i>Achilles</i>, battle ship, all dragged their
moorings, but not to any alarming extent. Staff-Captain
Burniston, who, with the dockyard tugs under his command,
was afloat during the whole of Monday night, and on
Tuesday, under very trying circumstances, succeeded in
getting out fresh anchors and hawsers to make the vessels
secure for the night, a course which was wisely adopted,
as the hurricane showed no signs of abating, there being,
on the contrary, another great fall in the barometer.
The men who were on board the tugs on Monday night,
speak of the weather as being the worst that they ever
experienced, and the manner in which they did their
work under such trying circumstances was, as was the
case so frequently throughout that, and several succeeding
days, most praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Considerable damage was done during Monday night
to many of the hookers belonging to the fishermen of
Kingsand and Cawsand. The full force of the blizzard
was experienced in Cawsand Bay, and ten of the hookers
which had been moored up for the night were driven
ashore and sunk. The only boat which rode out the
storm was a craft owned by Mr. Andrews of Cawsand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
A pilot boat went ashore in one of the little coves just
south of the coastguard station, and a small fishing
vessel was wrecked close under Lady Emma's Cottage,
at Mount Edgcumbe.</p>

<p>The captain of the Norwegian galliot <i>Falken</i>, from
Shields, with coal for Portugal which was found on
Tuesday off Fowey, by the tug <i>Belle of Plymouth</i>,
half full of water, and with her sails blown away, stated
at the time that on Monday his vessel was caught in a
kind of small cyclone, and that whilst about twenty
miles south-west of Start Point he had a strange experience.
The vessel was being driven along at a furious
rate by a north-easterly gale, whilst ahead, within sight,
a westerly wind was blowing. This bears out the theory
of the cyclone to some extent, as on other parts of the
coast the gale was found to blow only from the north-east
or south-east, in rapid changes. The Channel was
very rough at the time, and the vessel was greatly
endangered. On Tuesday the boats were smashed, and
the sails carried away. Pumps were manned, and kept
working so long as the crew could hold out, the endeavour
being to reach one of the ports. It was while the
<i>Falken</i> was in this condition that the <i>Belle</i> came opportunely
to her assistance, and towed her into Plymouth
harbour, where she was laid up alongside Bulteel's
Wharf, in the Cattewater, to discharge her cargo and be
repaired. Several of the Lowestoft boats, and other
fishing vessels which had been out in the Channel on
the Monday night, returned to Plymouth on Tuesday,
and reported having experienced very bad weather. The
sudden squalls encountered were terrific, and the oldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
fishermen on board declared that they had never experienced
such violent weather on the Devonshire coast.</p>

<p>During the height of the storm the schooner <i>Alice
Brookall</i>, from Swansea to Jersey with coals, ran ashore
at Mutton Cove, near Godevy Hayle. She ran so far in
that the crew&mdash;five in number&mdash;managed to drop from
the bowsprit on to the rocks. The poor fellows had to
pass the night exposed to the fury of the storm, with no
other protection than they could mutually afford each
other by huddling together. At daybreak they climbed
the cliffs, and managed to reach the shelter of a farm-house.
The vessel soon went to pieces. The schooner
<i>Perseverance</i>, of Preston, Dandy, master, from Swansea
to Salcombe, with coals, ran ashore a mile east of Hayle
Bar. The crew of four remained by her during the
night, and landed at daybreak. Both vessels experienced
fearful weather on the way down Channel, the sea
running mountains high. No one knew of their position
until twenty-four hours after they struck.</p>

<p>At Exmouth, Dawlish, and Teignmouth, although the
force of the wind was great, and all three towns sustained
damage, there were no calamities at sea. Great injury was
done to the pleasure and fishing boats at both of the latter
places, but Teignmouth was not so unfortunate as Dawlish
in this respect. Its harbour is almost land-locked, and
from the beach where the boats are moored, as well as
from the quays, the eye glances north-west and south-west
upon a beautiful picture of river scenery, of which
the distant Dartmoor Hills and the Haldon Heights
form the background. The accompanying illustration,
from a photograph by Messrs. Valentine &amp; Son, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Teignmouth, taken during the week of the blizzard,
depicts one part of this scene in as wintry a garb as any
it has worn during the last half century. The village of
Shaldon, on the opposite side of the Teign, lies exposed
to a S.E. gale blowing across the low-lying sands of the
Teignmouth "Point," and here the owners of fishing and
other craft had much to lament in the way of destruction
to their floating property.</p>

<p>In Torbay a French brig, the <i>Emilie</i>, of Cherbourg, was
driven ashore at Hogg's Cove, under Berry Head, at
about four o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. The coastguards
and Royal Naval Reserve, under the direction of
Mr. Drayton, chief officer of coastguard, and assisted by
a large number of fishermen, got out the rocket apparatus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and the crew, eight in number, were quickly landed.
They were at once invited to the house of the Misses
Hogg, at Berry Head, and provided with refreshments.
The vessel was badly injured, and became a total wreck.</p>

<p>The ketch <i>Sunshine</i>, of Faversham, from London to
Exmouth, with manure, was fallen in with on Thursday
at noon, by the Brixham fishing ketch <i>Inter-Nos</i>, Berry
Head bearing north-west, and distant twenty-five miles.
She had her mainsail blown away, and her boats and
water-casks washed overboard. When fallen in with, the
crew were without water to drink, and their vessel was
labouring heavily in the trough of the sea. The <i>Sunshine</i>
was taken in tow by the <i>Inter-Nos</i>, Â£250 being agreed
upon for the service, and both vessels arrived at Brixham
on the same night. The fishing ketch <i>Gertrude</i> arrived
in Brixham on Thursday, having on her deck the boat
of the <i>Crusader</i>, of Aberystwith, which she had picked
up in the channel with eight hands on her, and landed
at Falmouth on Friday. The ketch <i>Annie</i> also arrived,
with sails blown away, and her ballast shifted. The
<i>Olive &amp; Mary</i> and the <i>Pickwick</i>, ketches, had their
sails blown away and their bulwarks damaged. All the
crews described the gale as the heaviest they had ever
been out in, and one skipper stated that he had seen
four vessels founder without being able to render assistance.
Later news has not, however, verified this story.</p>

<p>Some trawlers were reported during the week as missing
from Brixham, but in course of time anxiety on their
account was removed, and they either reached home or
news of their safety was received from other ports to
which they had run for shelter. Some Plymouth trawlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were also in difficulties, and it was feared that they had
been wrecked, but in a few days their whereabouts was
ascertained, and it was discovered that they had escaped
with somewhat severe damage.</p>

<p>Start Point was on Monday night and again on the
succeeding Tuesday a scene of some heartrending
disasters. Many vessels, including the iron steamer
<i>Marana</i>, 1,682 tons register, belonging to Messrs.
George Bell and Co. of Liverpool; and the full-rigged
ship <i>Dryad</i>, 1,035 tons register, owned by J. B.
Walmsley, of Water Street, Liverpool, were totally
wrecked within a short distance of each other, resulting,
it is calculated, in an aggregate loss of over fifty lives.
The <i>Marana</i> left Victoria Dock, London, at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on
Sunday, March 1st, with a crew of twenty-eight. She
was bound for Colombo with a cargo of sleepers, but
was proceeding first to Swansea for coal. Whilst going
down Channel on Monday night she encountered the
gale which, charged with blinding snow, was blowing
heavily from the S.E., and struck on the Blackstone
Rock, at Start Point. Seeing that the vessel must go to
pieces very shortly, the officers and crew took to the
boats, most of them having life-belts on. The starboard
lifeboat, in charge of the boatswain and with twenty-two
men on board, proceeded in the direction of Prawle
Point, and was almost immediately followed by a smaller
boat in which were the captain, the chief engineer, the
mess-room steward, and three seamen. The latter boat
was soon separated from the lifeboat, and was never
seen again. The lifeboat got under the coastguard
station at Prawle, but the appearance of the coast was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
threatening, and the crew pushed off again. Almost
immediately a sea struck the boat and capsized her. A
bitter struggle for life on the part of the twenty immersed
seamen succeeded, and those who had clung to the boat
managed to get her righted, and clambered on board,
but soon after she was again turned over. Once more
she righted, and eventually drifted on to the Mal Rock
to the east of Prawle Point, where the four occupants&mdash;all
that remained of the crew of the vessel&mdash;contrived to
get on to the rocks.</p>

<p>After a while they climbed the cliff, three of them
carrying the fourth survivor, who was suffering from
exhaustion and injuries, and after heavy toil they
managed to get near to Prawle.   Here two of the men
agreed to remain with the shipmate, who to all appearance
was fast succumbing to exhaustion, while the other
went into the village for help.   The man, like his three
surviving comrades, was a Swede, and consequently
unable to make himself understood, but Mr. Perry,
Lloyd's signalman at Prawle, and the coastguardsman on
duty, supplied him with food and clothing, and then
went to search for traces of the wreck which had clearly
taken place not far off.   It was not until long past
midnight that the mates of the Swede were discovered,
and then it was too late to save the exhausted man, who
died almost immediately after their arrival.   The remaining
survivors were taken into Prawle, and under
kind treatment soon recovered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Briggs, wife of one of the lighthouse keepers at
the Start, says that she was looking out of her window a
little after half-past five o'clock on Monday evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
when she saw the steamer pass very close to the east
side of Start Point as if she had come out from the bay.
Seeing her great danger, and thinking it was impossible
for her to clear the rocks running off from the Point, she
hastened to another window, from which she had a view
of the Blackstone Rocks. She then saw the steamer
broadside on to the rocks. She at once gave an alarm
to Mr. Jones, the head-keeper, who hurried out to give
any assistance in his power, but within a very few
minutes the vessel parted in two, the stern part sinking
near the rocks, while the fore part washed away and
sank a short distance to the west of the Start.</p>

<p>Mr. Crickett, chief officer of Coastguards at Hallsands,
has stated that he received intelligence of the casualty at
6Â·40 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> by a messenger sent by Mr. Jones, of the Start
Lighthouse, who said the vessel had struck the rocks
about 500 yards south-east of the Start. He immediately
despatched a messenger to Prawle, a distance of
nearly five miles, for the life-saving apparatus. Another
messenger he sent to Torcross to Mr. Ridge, the chief
officer of Coastguards there, and Mr. Crickett then proceeded
to the scene of the wreck, but on arriving, nothing
could be seen of the vessel, as she had totally disappeared,
and she was supposed to have gone to pieces five
minutes after she struck. The coastguard at Hallsands
say that they saw the <i>Marana</i> fully an hour before she
struck, and she was then near the Skerries Bank, off the
Start, acting in such a manner that they considered her
steering gear was out of order. They saw her come into
the bay and afterwards go out again, and watched her
very closely, but they thought she had gone clear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Start until they heard otherwise from the lighthouse-keepers.</p>

<p>John Nelson, one of the survivors, said in the course
of his evidence at the inquest held on the first eight bodies
recovered from the wreck:&mdash;"On Monday, 9th inst., I
had tea at five o'clock, and went to my bunk. It was the
first mate's watch. As I was turning into my bunk I
heard someone shout out, 'Land right ahead.' It was
blowing a bit stiff in the afternoon at three o'clock, and
as the gale increased the canvas was taken in. The vessel
struck almost immediately after I heard the shout, and
the engines were going full-speed at the time. I came out
and stood in the forecastle door. The captain was then
on the bridge. The vessel struck first at the bow. When
I came on deck she struck aft as well, knocking her propeller
and rudder away. The captain then gave the
order to get the starboard lifeboat ready for launching.
All the three officers were on the bridge. The wind was
blowing hard, and the waves were dashing all over the
ship. It was daylight, but the Start light was lit. We
could see the land plainly enough, although it was thick
with heavy rain. There were two lifeboats, one on each
side of the ship, and two smaller boats. We lowered the
lifeboat and got into it, some 20 or 22 being in it, and
got away from the ship on the starboard side. The boat
was in charge of the boatswain, and the second and third
engineers and the chief steward were in the boat. We left
on board the captain, the three mates, the chief engineer,
and the mess-room steward. Just as we were turning to
get clear of the rocks, we looked at the ship, and saw
the captain and the others leave in the other boat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
starboard side. They got safely away from the ship.
After the vessel struck we hoisted a red pennant with a
white ball as a signal of distress. When we got away it
was getting dark, and we saw nothing of the other boat
afterwards, but supposed they were following us. We
pulled in shore to a kind of bay, but not thinking it safe to
land, we went out of that. We could see nothing but rocks
on our coming down, and in getting out of the bay our
boat capsized. There was a very heavy sea running up
against the rocks. We got hold of the keel of the boat,
some twelve or fourteen of us that remained, and then
the boat turned over again. After that only four or five
of us remained sticking to the boat. We stuck to the
boat until she broke up on the rocks. When I let go
the boat I could feel the rocks with my feet, and I then
walked on shore. There were four of us that came on
shore, but I could see nothing of any others. When we
got on shore we walked to a brake and got shelter. We
had to help Rasmossen up, as he had no boots on. He
was living half an hour before the coastguards found us,
but we had been on shore a long time before they found
us&mdash;about five or six hours."</p>

<p>Many of the bodies of the unfortunate men were
washed ashore within a few days, and not far from the
spot where the vessel went down. All of them were not
identified, as the survivors had joined the ship too
recently to be acquainted with all the officers and
crew.</p>

<p>Another serious calamity in Start Bay occurred during
Monday night, and not many hours later than the wreck
of the <i>Marana</i>, when the ship <i>Dryad</i>, bound for Valparaiso,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with a crew of 22 hands all told, went ashore
about a mile to the eastward of Start Point. When the
ship went on shore Mr. Hewett, with the life-saving
apparatus, had left Hallsands for Prawle, from whence
rumours of disaster had been brought, and he had got
as far as Chevilstone Cross when he was overtaken by
a mounted messenger despatched by the chief officer of
the coastguard at Torcross, who desired him to return
to the Start to the assistance of the <i>Dryad</i>. He got
to the scene of the wreck at half-past two in the morning.
By that time the vessel had broken up, all her masts
having gone overboard, and but little of her could be
discerned in the darkness. The place where she struck
was right under the high land of the Start where the
cliffs are very precipitous. With regard to this vessel,
the coastguardsmen say that they saw no signals of distress
whatever, and it has been considered probable that
she was proceeding with a fair wind down Channel, and
no land being visible in the snow-filled gloom of the
night, those on board were unconscious of their proximity
to the land until they found themselves on the
rocks. In this case there was, perhaps, no time to show
distress signals, and the ship may have been some time
ashore before she was discovered by the coastguards.</p>

<p>About midnight on the ninth, the storm was at its
height, and all men of Start Bay agree that they never
remember such a violent storm, the water of the bay
being one mass of foam, it being almost impossible to
look to the windward. Mr. Jones, the head keeper of
the Star Lighthouse, says he was standing in the yard by
his home a little after midnight, looking in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the Bay, when he saw right under the headland, and
close to the Start, what he considered to be a ship's
lights. He called the other keepers, and as well as they
were able they got down to the place where they saw the
lights. It was at the risk of their lives that they went
down the cliffs, and it was only by holding on to each
other they were prevented from being blown away. When
they got down they could not discover a vestige of anything,
neither did they hear a cry of any sort. The
coastguards at Hallsands also saw lights, and fired off a
rocket and burned a blue light to warn the ship of her
danger, but the vessel's lights were only seen a few
minutes before they disappeared.</p>

<p>In spite of all the efforts of those on shore no trace of
a ship could be seen, and it was not until daybreak the
next morning that a man was discovered lying on a low
rock, known as John Hatherley's Nose, some 500 yards
from the spot where the <i>Dryad</i> ultimately proved to have
struck. Help was at once sought for, and Mr. Briggs,
one of the keepers, and Mr. Pollyblank, the coastguard,
then returned to the rock with ropes. They threw the
rope on to the rocks, which fell only about a foot away
from the sailor. He saw it and then slid down, evidently
with the intention to secure the rope, but he seemed to
be afraid, and instead of slipping on the lower ledge of
the rock where the rope was, he climbed on the top
of the rock again, and laid himself flat on it on his face
and hands. He then seemed to lose his hold, and slid
down, holding on to the rocks for several seconds, when
he fell head over heels, and was washed away and
drowned. Those trying to rescue him, seeing how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
exhausted he was, had fetched a ladder to get to him,
and Mr. Briggs fastened a rope to himself to swim out to
him, but in the meantime he was washed away. He was
a young man. Grave doubts were expressed as to what
vessel he came from, for it seems almost impossible he
could have got to the rocks from the <i>Dryad</i>; and there
was some wreckage visible near the rocks that did not
appear to have belonged to the <i>Dryad</i>. The coastguards
at Hallsands said distinctly that the lights they saw
were a steamer's lights, whilst there is no doubt that the
lights the lighthouse-keepers saw were those of the <i>Dryad</i>.
Only a piece of the bow of the <i>Dryad</i> was discovered in
the morning, but a large mass of broken wreckage was
discovered along the coast, and tons of it were washed
out to sea by the next tide. Eight bodies were recovered,
and friends of those composing the crew of the <i>Dryad</i>
journeyed to Hallsands for the purpose of identifying
their friends or relatives. There were no survivors, and
consequently no details are known, but a statement has
been made that the channel pilot had warned the captain
that the ship's compass was two points out.</p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Crickett and some of the coastguards
under his charge at Hallsands were at the Start Point on
the night of the 9th, trying to render assistance to the
stranded steamship <i>Marana</i>, they saw a light in the bay,
and they answered it by burning a blue light, and one of
the coastguards was sent back to try and discover the
place the light proceeded from. On the remainder of
the coastguards returning to Hallsands shortly after, a
light was seen near Beesands, and on reaching that place
they found the schooner <i>Lunesdale</i> stranded.   Mr. Ridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the chief officer of coastguards stationed at Torcross, had
arrived with some of his men, and they, with the assistance
of the Beesands fishermen, were trying to effect a
communication with the vessel. The captain was in the
fore starboard rigging, and the remainder of the crew,
four in number, were in the starboard mizen rigging.
All these men were thus on the weather side of the ship,
and the captain not being so exposed from his position
as the others, succeeded with the utmost difficulty in
getting round to the other, or shore side of the vessel.
A fisherman named Roper, of Beesands, then at the risk
of his own life, made a desperate effort to save the
captain. He got a line with a lead attached to it, and
threw it close to the captain's feet, the latter succeeding,
after a frantic effort, to fasten the line to a lifebuoy, and
attached himself to it, and was then safely hauled on
shore. The other seamen were not so successful in
changing their positions, and in their endeavours they
were washed away and drowned. All this time the seas
were breaking right over the vessel. The coastguards
and fishermen remained by the vessel for nearly an hour
afterwards, shouting to see if they could get any response
from the crew, but getting none, all hope of saving
them was given up. When it was found that the Prawle
life-saving apparatus, in charge of Mr. Hewett, could be
of no service to the <i>Marana</i>, a message was left at Start
farm for it to be brought on to Beesands to the help of
the <i>Lunesdale</i>, but it arrived too late to be of any
service. The <i>Lunesdale</i> was a three-masted schooner of
141 tons register, owned by Messrs. James Fisher &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Sons, of Barrow, and was bound from London to a
Lancashire port.</p>

<p>While efforts were being made at Beesands to save the
crew of the <i>Lunesdale</i>, a schooner named <i>Lizzie Ellen</i>,
73 tons register, and belonging to Mr. Samuel Coppack,
of Chester, with a cargo of clay from Charlestown for
London, went on shore just opposite Hallsands. In
spite of the tremendous force of the wind and the
blinding spray and snow six fishermen, named T. Trout,
George Stone, Robert Trout, James Lynn, William
Mitchell, and John Patey, at the imminent peril of their
lives, made a gallant effort to rescue the crew of the
vessel, which consisted of four hands. With great difficulty,
and by the aid of ropes, these men succeeded in
lowering themselves to the bottom of the cliff. By
throwing lines on board the schooner the mate and the
third hand were saved, but the captain and the boy were
lost. The captain, Robert Dood, urged the boy, who
was crying bitterly, to jump over into the sea, with the
chance of being drawn on shore, but he could not
persuade him to take the leap. At length the captain
jumped himself, but at the wrong time, and he was
carried out by a receding wave. The boy, Frank Davis,
also perished.</p>

<p>For some time after this week of tempest, all along
the coast from Prawle to the Start, could be seen broken
wreckage. Such was the fury of the gale that everything
seemed split to matchwood. It is supposed that other
wrecks than those of which some knowledge has been
obtained occurred on this eventful night. Mr. Crickett,
a coastguardsman, picked up on the following Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a board bearing the words "Nymph of T&mdash;&mdash;," it being
broken off at the letter T, and it is conjectured that this
may belong to one of the vessels referred to. A painful
sequel to the wreck of the <i>Marana</i> occurred on
Wednesday, March 18th, nine days after the catastrophe.
A molecatcher of Prawle found at about half-past
eleven, in a field half a mile from a village named
Furze Brake, and about a quarter of a mile from the sea,
the body of a man. The corpse was lying flat upon
its face, and was clothed in an oil-skin coat in addition
to the ordinary kind of seaman's dress. A life-belt
was lying close by, and the locality was not more than
a hundred yards from the spot where the two survivors
from the <i>Marana</i> had been found supporting to the
best of their power their dying comrade. Unknown to
the other survivors this man must have succeeded in
reaching the shore, but only to die. Undoubtedly he
walked in search of help and shelter until he sank from
exhaustion, and was covered with a fall of snow thick
enough to screen his body from view until a thaw had
set in.</p>

<p>The inquests held on the bodies of those unfortunate
seamen who lost their lives in the vicinity of the Start
have had the effect of a communication being made to
the Board of Trade as to the necessity of life-saving
apparatus being placed at Hallsands. In the face of a
hurricane of almost unprecedented force, many gallant
and eager attempts were made to save life, but with only
a very limited measure of success, owing as much to the
want of suitable appliances as to the rugged character of
the coast, and the merciless fury of the gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Along the coast, in the neighbourhood of Falmouth,
which from its exposed position was fully open to the
strength of the blizzard, there were more disastrous
wrecks, and here also the loss of life was great. The
most serious calamity occurred at about half-past one on
Tuesday morning, and was that which, at Penare Point,
near Helford River, befell the four-masted steel ship
<i>Bay of Panama</i>, of London, 2,282 tons register. This
vessel, owned by the Bullock's Bay Line, was from
Calcutta, with a cargo of 17,000 bales of jute for
Dundee. The captain, David Wright, of Liverpool, his
wife, all but one of the six officers, four apprentices, and
six of the crew, were either frozen to death in the rigging
or drowned. This made a loss of eighteen lives out of a
company of about forty all told.</p>

<p>At the village of St. Keverne, not far from Penare
Point, it became known at about noon on Tuesday that
a wreck had occurred at the mouth of the Helford
River, and from there the first news of what had occurred
was conveyed into Falmouth, with great courage, and in
the face of tremendous difficulties, by Mr. J. H. James, of
Old Vicarage, St. Keverne. At one o'clock, Mr. James
started on his pony for Helston in the midst of a terrible
snowstorm. His intention was to telegraph to Falmouth,
but all the wires were down, and communication was
impossible except on foot. This he undertook, and by
dauntless perseverance at length accomplished; but
his experiences during the journey are among the most
thrilling personal incidents connected with the gale. After
proceeding for about two miles, he could only get along by
crawling on his hands and knees through the snow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his face had become coated with snow, and icicles hung
from his ears. He at last found shelter at a wayside
cottage, and at daybreak next morning again set out,
reaching Falmouth at 9 o'clock, and giving information
to Messrs. Broad and Sons, who sent out steamers to the
scene of the wreck. The <i>Bay of Panama</i> was discovered
with her head to the north, broadside on to the sea, and
jammed under the Nare Head, close against the cliff.
Her mainmast was gone, and the sea was making clean
breaches right over her.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the survivors clinging to the stranded
ship, before Mr. James had started on his adventurous
journey to Falmouth, on Tuesday morning, the rocket
apparatus, in charge of the coastguard, who were
aroused by Mr. Nicholls, of Penare, had reached the
scene from Helford. The first rocket fired threw a
line right over the ship, and within fifteen minutes the
whole of the survivors were safely on shore. Chief
boatman Fisher, of the coastguard, went on board the
vessel after the hands taken off to see if any one was
left alive, but his self-sacrifice was without result. Accounts
of survivors, including those of Mr. Fred Evans,
boatswain's mate, Mr. Charles Higgins, quartermaster,
and Mr. Beresford, apprentice, relate that the <i>Bay of
Panama</i> was 111 days from Calcutta when she struck.
There had been forty-two days of severe weather before
reaching the western end of the English Channel, and
here severe snowstorms and heavy squalls were encountered.
At half-past eleven on Sunday night they
sighted a light, and being in a position of danger they
burned several blue lights, the captain thinking the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
came from a steamer. The vessel was now drifting
to leeward without a stitch of canvas on her, and the
captain soon expressed the opinion that they were to
leeward of the Lizard and clear of all land. At half-past
twelve the watch went below, put on some clean clothes,
and got into their bunks. The captain remained on
deck, his wife being in her cabin.</p>

<p>Within an hour from this time the ship struck and
began rapidly to fill. Most of those who had been
below went forward, though the forecastle had been
burst in, and was flooded. Seas were breaking over the
vessel, and nearly all the officers were early swept away.
The second officer went to fetch a rocket, and was never
seen again. Attempts were made to get a line on shore,
and one seaman is said to have volunteered to swim the
distance, but the former was found impracticable, and
in the latter case the other seamen held their comrade
back. Some of the crew took refuge in the rigging, and
at daybreak the second quartermaster died there, the
mate died an hour after, and the boatswain, in a state of
delirium, jumped from the mizzen-top into the sea and
was drowned. Just before six o'clock in the morning,
the after-end of the ship broke in two, the mainmast
having previously fallen. It is said that, at the time the
rescuing party arrived on the scene, six men were frozen
in the rigging. The survivors were taken to St. Keverne
Farm, which they reached at half-past ten on Tuesday
morning, and where they were kindly treated. They
remained there until four in the afternoon, when they
were conveyed to Gweek in a 'bus. From here it
was absolutely necessary for them to walk to Falmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
through the snow, and as many of them were thinly
clad, and had no boots, their trials were not over
until Falmouth was reached, where Messrs. Jewell
and Burton, and Mr. and Mrs. Weir, of the Royal
Cornwall Sailors' Home, treated them with all the kindness
and attention they so much needed. Most of the
bodies from the <i>Bay of Panama</i> were recovered, that of
the Captain's wife having been found lying on the shore
early on the morning of the wreck.</p>

<p>Though this was the most serious wreck near Falmouth,
it was far from being the only one. Reports of wrecks
and loss of life continued to be received for many days
following the beginning of the gale on Monday. Near
Porthoustock, on Monday night, the sloop <i>Dove</i>, of
Topsham, was lost, but in this case the crew were
saved. The <i>Dove</i> left Exmouth Bight on March 8th,
arriving at Plymouth Breakwater early on Monday morning.
Just after daybreak, in company with several other
vessels, she left for Falmouth. There was a strong wind
blowing, which, as time went on, increased with much
violence, and was followed by a blinding snowstorm. The
captain and mate of the <i>Dove</i>, who were both at the helm,
could, they said afterwards, scarcely see their hands
before them. At about three o'clock in the afternoon the
vessel was near the Manacle Rocks, and off Porthoustock
Cove, and here, while in a most critical situation, the
tremendous sea lifted the little craft clean over the rocks,
and she was washed up on the beach. The skipper threw
his little boy overboard, he and his mate following in
the same way, and all were rescued by those persons on
shore. Near the same spot, the ketch <i>Aquilon</i>, of Jersey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and the ketch <i>Edwin</i>, were reported lost with all
hands.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Stannington</i>, from Newport to Exeter with
a cargo of potatoes, broke her shaft on Monday off the
Longships, and was towed into Falmouth on Wednesday
afternoon. The barque <i>Frith</i>, of Lorne, 333 tons, from
Hamburg to Glasgow, in ballast, was in a critical condition
on Tuesday, about ten miles south of the Lizard.
She slipped from the tug towing her, and was on her beam
ends, and fast making water, when she was picked up by
the <span class="smcap">s.s.</span> <i>Anglesea</i>, of Liverpool, and towed into Falmouth.
A German steamer, the <i>Carl Hirschberg</i>, from Hamburg
to Cardiff in ballast, drove ashore at Portscatho. The
schooner <i>Agnes and Helen</i>, of Beaumaris, went ashore on
Tuesday morning in Bream Bay. A steamship named
the <i>Dundela</i>, from St. Michael for Hull, with fruit, was
totally wrecked at Portloe, near Falmouth, on Monday
night. All the crew, except a boy named Taylor, who
was lost, were brought ashore over the rocks by the aid
of the fishermen and coastguard, who contrived to get a
line from the shore to the vessel. The brig <i>Crusader</i>, of
Aberystwith, from Carnarvon, with slate for Hamburg,
was abandoned at one o'clock on Tuesday off Trevose
Head, with seven feet of water in her hold. The
<i>Crusader</i> left Carnarvon at nine o'clock on Monday morning,
in fine weather. It remained fine up to six o'clock
the same evening, when severe weather was encountered.
At nine o'clock, off the Bishop, it was blowing a gale, and
the brig was fast making water. The pumps were kept
going until one o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, when it
was found impossible to keep the water under. The brig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was therefore abandoned, having seven feet of water in
her hold. The captain and crew, seven all told, took to
the boat, in which they were tossed about for nineteen
hours, enduring great privation. The weather was
bitterly cold, and the men were almost frozen. One of
the crew, Thomas Owen, succumbed to his sufferings at
four o'clock on Wednesday morning. "Another two
hours in the boat," remarked Captain Williams, "and we
should have all perished." To keep the boat from being
swamped, she rode with sea-anchor out, and everything
was thrown overboard, including spare clothes. At eight
o'clock on Wednesday morning, when thoroughly
exhausted, they were fortunately picked up by the fishing
smack <i>Gertrude</i>, about thirty miles off the land, and
arrived at Falmouth on the same day. The crew were
received at the Sailors' Home.</p>

<p>The crew of the Netherlands barque <i>Magellan</i> were
taken into Falmouth on the evening of Sunday, March
16th, the vessel having foundered on the previous Thursday
in the Channel, in lat. 47Â·48 N., long. 6Â·53 W.</p>

<p>A large number of minor accidents at sea occurred on
this part of the coast, and while the Channel outside contained
numerous traces of floating wreckage, disabled
vessels of all descriptions were either being towed or
making their way into Falmouth. Rumours of missing
vessels were being continually received, and the time
was one of great anxiety. All the help that could
be given was needed for those who had escaped with
their lives, and others who were known to be still at sea,
probably in situations of peril, and this assistance was
very willingly afforded. Most efficient and welcome aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was rendered by the local Branch of the Shipwrecked
Mariners' Aid Society to the distressed crews. The
captain and crew of the <i>Crusader</i> (six men), the crew
of the <i>Agnes and Helen</i>, the crew of the <i>Dungella</i> (eleven
men), and the survivors of the crew of the <i>Bay of
Panama</i> (sixteen men) were provided with free railway
passes to their several homes, and each man supplied
with food for the journey, by the hon. agent of the society
at that port (Mr. F. H. Earle), who also boarded, lodged,
and otherwise provided for the crews of the two first-named
vessels, the men being more or less destitute. The
homes of the men were Bangor, Aberystwith, and other
places in Wales, and London, Liverpool, Hull, and Great
Yarmouth. At a public meeting held in the public hall
on Tuesday evening, many promises for subscriptions
towards a fund in aid of the boatmen were received.</p>

<p>Some dissatisfaction was expressed that during the
wrecks at Porthoustock and Porthalla, on March 9th,
when about thirty lives were lost, no life-boat had been
launched, and the National Lifeboat Institution sent to
St. Keverne, about a fortnight after the occurrence,
Commander Biddors, R.N., who made inquiries into the
matter. It appeared on investigation that some of the
life-boat crew did not readily respond to the call signals,
their explanation being that they did not hear or see
them. When they arrived at the life-boat station the
storm had increased, and it was dangerous to put to sea.
A proposal for the provision of a smaller life-boat, requiring
fewer oars, has been submitted to the life-boat
committee.</p>

<p>Off Scilly, several accidents occurred, but they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
neither so numerous nor attended with the same fatal
results as those on the coast further east. The ketch
<i>Aunt</i>, Bude, was taken into Plymouth in a disabled
condition, and with only two of the crew that remained
severely ill from frostbites. On Saturday morning,
14th March, when in latitude 7Â·20 W., and longitude
48Â·7 W., about 233 miles S.SW. of Scilly, the <i>Astrea</i>,
Captain Burton, sighted the <i>Aunt</i> some miles off with
her sails down and flying a signal of distress. She bore
down upon her, and Captain Burton sent alongside a
boat's crew, who found the captain, H. Hines, and a
sailor named Jewett wrapped in the mainsail in a shocking
state, and scarcely able to speak. Their hands and
legs were also so much swollen from frostbites and
exposure that they could not handle anything or lift
themselves up or stand. Brandy and medicine were
administered to them, and after a time they sufficiently
recovered to be able to inform their rescuers that the
<i>Aunt</i> was ten days out from Sandersfoot with coals.
Four days before a lad named Stapleton had died from
exposure, and his body was thrown overboard.</p>

<p>A serious collision, resulting in the loss of twenty-two
lives, happened during the week of the gale about 140
miles south-west of Scilly, at 9 o'clock on the evening of
Friday the 13th March. Two vessels, the <i>Roxburg Castle</i>,
of Newcastle, a steamship of 1,222 tons register, and the
<i>British Peer</i>, ship, 1428 tons, came into collision just as
the gale that had been blowing all the week was moderating,
and the steamer was struck with considerable
force by the <i>British Peer</i> a little abaft the funnel. She
was almost cut in two, and filled so rapidly that in about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ten minutes she sank, losing twenty-two out of a total of
twenty-four hands. As a further result of the collision,
the <i>British Peer</i> had her bows stove in, and carried away
her bowsprit, jibboom, and head gear. The forward
bulkhead held good, and kept the vessel afloat. After
the collision nothing could be done to save the lives of
the crew of the <i>Roxburg Castle</i>, although their piteous
cries for help were plainly heard on the <i>British Peer</i>.
Captain Tyrer, a splendid swimmer, whilst in the water
combated the waves, took his clothes off in the water,
and was picked up by the <i>British Peer</i>, as was also one
of the seamen, an A.B. The drowned men are reported
to be principally from Newport. After the <i>Roxburg
Castle</i> had sunk, the <i>British Peer</i> was fallen in with,
about ninety miles south-west of the Wolf Rock,
by the steamship <i>Morglay</i>, of Southampton, Captain
Hughes, from Cardiff to Marseilles, and towed to off the
Manacles, where she was transferred to the tug <i>Triton</i>,
and taken into Falmouth harbour. Captain Tyrer was
very much knocked about during his swim to the <i>British
Peer</i>.</p>

<p>The Hamburg American Company's steamship <i>Suevia</i>,
2,440 tons, had a narrow escape in the Channel on
Monday night. The <i>Suevia</i> passed the Lizard on
Monday morning, and there were then evident indications
of a coming storm. At 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the wind began to
blow heavily from the north-east, and at 2Â·30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> it
raged with hurricane fury, accompanied by a blinding
snowstorm. The seas ran very high, and the ship
laboured heavily. At about three o'clock, when eight
miles east of the Start Point, the engineer reported that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the lower pressure piston rod had given out, and that in
consequence the machinery was disabled. An endeavour
was then made to work the other engine, but unsuccessfully,
and sail was then put on the vessel. By this means
she was prevented from driving ashore during the terrific
squalls that were blowing dead on the land. After a
night and day of great danger, a schooner was sighted
on Tuesday afternoon, which the captain of the <i>Suevia</i>
considered went down in one of the squalls. On Wednesday
the steamer <i>Acme</i> was fallen in with, and on her the
chief officer proceeded to Falmouth for assistance. During
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, efforts were made to
repair the machinery, and these meeting at last with
some success, by early on Friday the vessel was headed
up channel, and proceeded at a slow pace until the
Eddystone was sighted. The passengers of the <i>Suevia</i>
were landed at Plymouth, from whence they were sent
on to Hamburg. The distance the <i>Suevia</i> drifted from
the scene of the accident until Friday at noon was 125
miles, and it was very fortunate that they were able to
keep clear of the coast. Steamers from Plymouth,
London, and Falmouth, the latter with the officer of the
<i>Suevia</i> who had gone on shore for help, were looking for
the vessel, but happily their services were not required.
But for the excellent seamanship and mechanical skill of
those on board, another dreadful calamity would doubtless
have been added to the long list already recorded.</p>

IN TOWN AND COUNTRY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ashburton.</span>&mdash;Enormous drifts fell at Ashburton
during the blizzard, and most of the roads were completely
blocked. At Holne Turn, half a mile from the
town, there was an enormous drift a quarter of a mile
in extent, and varying in height from eight to twenty
feet. Railway and postal arrangements were pretty well
adjusted by the end of the week, and business began to
proceed as usual. There were some serious losses of
stock by farmers in the neighbourhood, and apple-orchards
were greatly injured. Masses of snow lodged
in the branches of the trees, and broke them down,
many of the younger trees having every branch
broken off close to the stump. In sheltered valleys the
drifts of snow were so great that scarcely a tree escaped
injury. Bakers who supplied country residents were
unable to go out to them with their supplies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barnstaple.</span>&mdash;The chief town of North Devon had a
very harsh experience. Traffic was for some time
suspended, but the inconvenience in this respect was
not nearly so great as in the south of Devon and in
Cornwall. In the districts around Barnstaple there were
very heavy losses of sheep and lambs. Farmers near
Morthoe were particularly unfortunate, nearly two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hundred sheep and lambs belonging to them having
perished. Through roads and railways being blocked
the markets were greatly interfered with, and this,
besides cutting off from many of the country people
their weekly supplies, was a great loss to the tradespeople
of the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bideford</span>, which has already been referred to, did
not suffer so severely as many other North Devon towns.
Railway communication with Ilfracombe was entirely
suspended throughout Tuesday, the 10th, but as the
weather moderated the line was cleared without any
very great amount of inconvenience having been
experienced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bodmin.</span>&mdash;In this important western town there was
an almost entire cessation of traffic from Monday afternoon
until the closing days of the week. The telegraphic
and train services were suspended, causing the
usual amount of loss and distress. Business on the
Tuesday was entirely suspended, snow falling heavily all
day, and a large quantity of snow in the street stopped
all vehicular traffic. The drifts were so high that
residents who had driven from the town on Monday
could not return, and great anxiety was naturally felt for
their safety. It was found on the following day, however,
that in all cases, the travellers were safe. Not
infrequently they had been obliged to take the horses
out of their vehicles, leave traps or carriages in the roads&mdash;often
under the snow&mdash;and seek shelter in the nearest
farm-house. There were very serious losses of sheep in
this district. Among others, losses of this description
were sustained by Mr. Rowse, of Llancarpe, Mr. Glanville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of Pen Bugle, and Mr. G. Spear, of Bodmin. Many
sheep were rescued, but only after great difficulty. On
Thursday night there was again a heavy snowstorm,
accompanied by a gale of wind, but it was neither so
severe nor of such long duration as the blizzard of
Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brent.</span>&mdash;This moorland town has grown famous
through the snowing up at its gates of the "Zulu" express,
from London, on the memorable Monday night.
Snow fell there from Monday afternoon to Wednesday
morning. A snow-plough with three engines arrived
from Newton Abbott on Thursday morning, but for
some time it was not very effective, the snow being so
high on either side of the line that as soon as the way
was fairly clear the banks in the rear of the plough
toppled over, and the line was once more blocked. The
depth of the snow in the town was so great as to be
frequently above the windows and doors of the houses.
A road cutting scene was photographed at the time by
Mr. Rowe, of Devonport, to whom we are indebted for the
view. The loss of cattle here was very great, nearly every
farmer having suffered. A large number of cattle, sheep
and ponies in the possession of residents of the neighbourhood
grazed upon the adjacent moor, and many of
the former, at all events, perished. Mr. Linerdon, of
Yelland, lost cattle to the value of over Â£100; Mr.
Pinney, of Diptfort, dug out 100 sheep from the snow;
while Mr. Heath, of Brent Mills, Mr. Vooght, of Lutton,
and Mr. S. Northmore were heavy losers. Mr. Luscombe,
of Hall, Harford, had on the moor 600 Scotch
cattle and 1,200 sheep, a large proportion of which he
has not yet recovered. Mr. J. Smerdon, of Brent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Mr. Hurrell, of Bradridge, lost sheep; and Miss
Maunder, Mr. B. Hingston, and Mr. J. Hard lost
ponies. Until Saturday the residents of Binnicknowle,
a village about two miles from Brent, and largely dependent
upon it for supplies of food, were unable to
obtain provisions. On that day, however, a party of
labourers succeeded in cutting a footway and thus communication
was opened up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brixham.</span>&mdash;This historic fishing town, which has
before now witnessed some dreadful instances of the
disaster to life and property that furious gales with
blinding snowstorms can bring about, was not on the
occasion of the blizzard of 1891 allowed to pass off very
lightly. There was no loss of life, but some rather
serious injuries happened to the trawlers at their moorings.
At daylight on Tuesday it was seen that many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
these had fouled each other, by dragging their anchors.
In the inner harbour most of the craft had broken adrift,
running against the quays and other places, and doing
themselves all kinds of damage. One trawler, named
the <i>Alice</i>, which broke adrift at high tide, was carried up
to the head of the harbour with her bowsprit eight feet
in over the Strand, close alongside the Prince of Orange
statue. About 200 feet of the breakwater was washed
away, and its pedestal was lost. Timber in large
quantities was washed away from the yards of the
principal shipbuilders, and in addition to the wreck of
the French brig, and others before mentioned, a boat
was driven on the rocks at Fishcombe, and the Seamen's
Orphan Home lifeboat went ashore, and was badly
knocked about. In the town many houses were unroofed,
and slates flew about, serious damage being also
done to a wall and embankment in Higher Street.
Large quantities of glass-roofing were smashed in, and
a good deal of glass was destroyed at Newmarket
Hall. Many farmers lost sheep and lambs in the snow-drifts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bude.</span>&mdash;The outside world and Bude were not so
thoroughly estranged during the days succeeding the
storm as was the case in some other instances, telegraphic
communication remaining unbroken. All the
other inconveniences of the blizzard&mdash;absence of mails,
presence of immense drifts of snow, and similar discomforts&mdash;were
freely experienced. There was an anxious
time among the shipping interest in the port, many of
the coasting vessels being at sea at the time the hurricane
was raging.   These vessels did not all escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
without calamity, but, on the whole, the damage wrought
to the shipping of Bude was not great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calstock.</span>&mdash;The mining town of Calstock received
some rough treatment during the Monday and Tuesday
of the storm, and damage was here and there done to
house property, but as far as the town was concerned it
may be safely said to have escaped marvellously well.
Bearing in mind its exposed position on the river bank,
and the many tall chimneys that rear their heads from
the hillside, it is singular that no smash of any magnitude
has to be recorded. This is all the more remarkable
when the tremendous destruction that occurred in
the district, and even close to the town, is considered.
On the opposite side of the river, the tracks leading
through the woods to Buralston Station were rendered
nearly impassable by the number of trees that fell, and
the whole wood through which the path runs was a
complete wreck. Mr. James, at the Passage Inn, from
which the ferry leaves to cross to Calstock, was very
unfortunate, his loss being a severe one. In addition to
great damage to his rose-trees, for which his house has
for many years been famous, the well-known blossom-covered
wicker bower, standing to the left of the house,
was blown bodily away into the orchard, and almost
simultaneously his cherry and apple trees began to fall.
Of these he lost fifty-six.</p>

<p>One curious incident happened at the grounds of Mr.
James, in the apparently narrow escape of a couple
of geese. The geese were sitting behind a barn, with
twenty-two eggs under them. During the storm of Monday,
the barn having been badly knocked about, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
whole orchard in a state of wreck, the fate of the geese
was not held in much doubt, and the depth of the snow
in the place making salvage operations very difficult, their
place of concealment was not reached until Thursday
after the storm. The snow being cleared from the back
of the barn, however, the geese were found still sitting in
the same position as that in which they had last been
seen. With the exception that they had evidently worked
their heads about, keeping the cavities large enough to
give them breathing room, it was quite clear that they
had not attempted to move. Warm food and hay were at
once given to them, and they were made as comfortable
as possible, and in due course, eleven goslings were
hatched from the twenty-two eggs upon which the parent
geese had sat through such a trying time. The young
geese are now as sturdy as could be desired, and Mr.
James is naturally very proud of them for having seen the
light in spite of such difficulties. The mother geese will
also, in all probability, be preserved as curiosities for some
time to come.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river a shed belonging to
Mr. Goss's shipbuilding yards was blown down, and
cattle-sheds were unroofed and carried great distances
by the force of the gale. At Danescombe Bottom, at the
foot of Kelly Rock, an iron schooner, the <i>NaÃ¯ad</i>, 250 tons,
owned by Captain Samuels of Calstock, was blown over
on her beam ends. The river banks, against which the
masts of the vessel struck, only prevented her being
turned completely over. After considerable labour she was
righted, but was found to have sustained some damage.
At the Rumleigh Brick-works, and at the yards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Mr. Roskelly, builder, of Albaston, much injury was occasioned.
The mineral and goods line, the property of the
East Cornwall Mineral Railway Company, running from
Calstock to Kelly Bray, near Callington was blocked with a
drift of snow some eight feet deep, and work was stopped
for two days. At the end of that time it was cleared by
a gang of the company's own men acting under the direction
of Captain W. Sowden. On the same property about
fifty yards of fencing were completely levelled. Honeycomb
House, about two miles from Calstock, was damaged
to the extent of about Â£100; Mr. Gill, of Tray Hill, lost
over 100 apple trees, and Mr. German 250 fruit trees.
The heaviest damage to trees was at Cotehele Woods, the
property of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, and overlooking
Calstock, which would appear to have received the
full fury of the blast. The terrible night passed here, and
the extent of the destruction to timber, will be found
dealt with at length in the chapter on Parks and Forests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camborne.</span>&mdash;The change at Camborne would appear
to have been an unusually startling one, since a few days
before Monday, butterflies were to be seen flying about.
Snow commenced to fall in the district at two o'clock on
Monday afternoon, and this soon developed into the
blizzard. The storm is described as the greatest and the
most severe known by the oldest residents in the parish.
The telegraph wires were blown down, and, lying across
the streets, threw several horses down. The houses were
so covered with snow as to be almost unrecognizable, and
in many places the drifts were over six feet deep. Ornamental,
and other trees in the town were completely
spoiled, and traffic was suspended. Anxiety was at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
time felt in the town for the safety of four young girls,
dressmakers, of Beacon village, who left the town on the
Monday evening, but it was afterwards learned that they
were all in safety. In Burse-road and Pendarmes-road
the shrubs and trees were broken down, and lay overhanging
and obstructing the footpaths. Passages had to
be cut to get to the houses, half as high as the houses
themselves. A 'bus running between Camborne and
Truro was snowed up near Pool, and left in the road; and
near it was an abandoned organ, the peripatetic performer
on which had been unable to bear it with him to
a place of safety.</p>

<p>At a village about a mile and a half from Camborne
drifts of snow were observed thirty feet deep. In the
town the Board schools were closed for the week. All
communication with surrounding towns was, as a matter
of course, cut off for several days. At Beacon and
Troon, adjoining villages, people were taken from their
bedroom windows by means of ladders; and in one case,
at a funeral, the coffin had to be slid down over a
snowdrift. At Breage a woman was found dead in the
snow. Farmers were busy in every direction rescuing
their cattle and sheep from the exposed positions, but the
losses in the neighbourhood were very great, hundreds of
sheep being buried. Among others who suffered in this
way were Mr. Carter, of Troon, who lost nearly twenty
sheep and lambs; Mr. Hickens, of Tregear; Mr. Glasson,
of Crowan; Mr. Josiah Thomas, of Roskear, Tuckingmill;
and Mr. P. Thomas, of Camborne. Several
donkies and ponies in the district perished. The little
villages of Penponds, Kehelland, and Pengegon, presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a wretched appearance, and at Penponds especially
it was impossible to distinguish any hedges. Mr. E.
Rogers, who had undertaken to carry out some funeral
arrangements at this village, was obliged to take the
coffin over hedges and ditches in order to get it to the
house. At Pengegon, where the water-supply is solely
obtained from wells and springs, it was found necessary
to use melted snow for domestic purposes. The old
thatched farmhouse of Pengegon, on the Wednesday,
when the sun shone, presented a strikingly beautiful
appearance, and was a prominent feature of the landscape.</p>

<p>The village of Treslothan also shared the effect of the
storm. Trees were damaged and blown down in large
numbers, and even as late as Good Friday snow nearly
a foot deep lay on some of the paths. A large amount
of damage was also done to trees and shrubs at
Reskadirmick, the abode of Captain W. C. Vivian, the
beautiful carriage drive to the house being terribly
disfigured. At the factories and mines business operations
were, for some time, entirely suspended, and it is
calculated that during the week quite a thousand persons
of both sexes were enforcedly idle. Work might have
gone on at the factories, but in many cases the
operatives were unable to leave their homes. At the
mines there was great anxiety, it being feared that the
engines would stop for want of coals. Passages were,
however, in time cut through, and not more than two or
three engines actually ceased working. Cuttings were
made from the railway station to South Condurrow and
Wheal Grenville mines, a distance of more than a mile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
So urgent was the need for coal at West Seaton mine on
Saturday, the 14th, that forty miners were sent to help the
labourers from Portreath to make a road from the railway
to the mine. The Wheal Grenville and Newton mines
were stopped for want of coal for some days. At
Dolcoath, however, considerable difficulty was experienced
on the floors in getting a sufficient supply of water to work
the stamps, owing to the leats being blocked. At the
fire stamps, in particular, both engines for a time ceased
work, and operations were not again renewed until late
on Tuesday afternoon. The openworks suffered considerably,
as it took nearly the whole of the week to
clear away the snow from the frames and huddles. The
miners themselves were greatly inconvenienced owing to
some of their homes being situated at a distance from the
mines, and their being unable to get to their work; while
many who had been working underground during the
afternoon, found, on coming to the surface, that they
could not reach their residences. At Crowan, the Rev.
H. Molesworth St. Aubyn, organized and worked hard
with a body of men to help in opening up communication
with Camborne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camelford.</span>&mdash;At this place experience, for almost the
entire week, was very bitter. The residents were absolutely
shut in from Monday to Friday. The last sign of
the outer world was when the North Cornwall Coach,
notwithstanding the snow already accumulated on the
moors, passed through on its way from Launceston
to Wadebridge. The market on Thursday was a dead
failure, no live stock being obtainable, and carcases
very scarce. There were many narrow escapes met with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
but no actual loss of life occurred. As the week passed
away provisions became very scarce, and there was a
growing alarm. On Friday, however, four persons on
horseback, unrecognizable from the quantity of snow that
covered them, entered the town in single file. The
party consisted of Mr. George Martyn, late of Trewen,
Manager of the North Cornwall Coach Company, Mr.
Hicks, one of the clerks at Wadebridge, and the coachman
and guard of the coach which had gone through on
Monday. The party, who brought with them a very
welcome copy of the <i>Western Morning News</i>, held an interview
with Mr. Evelyn, the Town Clerk of Camelford,
and subsequently, under the direction of the road-surveyor,
a body of men was organized to cut through the
three miles of snow-covered road between Camelford
and Wadebridge, for the purpose of opening up a means
of obtaining provisions from the latter place. This was
ultimately accomplished, and by Tuesday, March 17th,
the North Cornwall Coach was once more able to run to
Launceston, and the Mail, from Camelford to Boscastle,
also ran. Hundreds of sheep were lost, the drifts of
snow being so high that much time was lost in getting at
those that were buried beneath, and they were taken out
dead in large numbers. Mr. Pethick, Mr. Inch, Mr.
Lobb, and Mr. Greenwood, in addition to many farmers,
suffered severely in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cargreen.</span>&mdash;At this riverside village, situated on the
banks of the Tamar, the gale of Monday and Tuesday
caused great havoc among the fruit-trees. Mr. E. Elliott,
of Landulph, lost about three hundred apple-trees, many
of which had been planted by himself thirty years
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dartmouth.</span>&mdash;At Dartmouth the storm was severe,
and all telegraphic communication was cut off during the
week of the gale, but by the following Sunday a staff of
telegraphic engineers had restored communication with
Exeter by a single wire, and also with Brixham. On
one night during the week a wall gave way at the
Castle churchyard and fell on to the rocks beneath,
carrying with it several tombstones, and disturbing the
coffins in the graves. At the market on Friday morning
buyers arrived in the town by train, from all parts, for
the purpose of buying provisions, but their journey was
fruitless, as the farmers had not been able to get into
the town, the roads being impassable for vehicles.
Railway traffic was only partially suspended, but the
first through communication to Kingsbridge was not
effected until Monday the 16th, when Mr. Sanders,
driver of the Dartmouth coach, managed, with the
assistance of Mr. Cross, of Strete, Mr. Watson, of
Chillington, and a number of volunteers, to get a conveyance
through from Dartmouth. They had to cut
their way through about two miles of snowdrifts, which
in many places, were upwards of six feet deep. When
Mr. Sanders and his party got to Frogmore they invited
the co-operation of the villagers, offering money and beer
for help. This, however, was declined, but the party
arrived in Kingsbridge shortly before three o'clock,
about two hours later than the usual time of the arrival
of the Dartmouth coach. Messrs. Cross and Watson
rendered admirable service. The only papers delivered
between Dartmouth and Kingsbridge since Monday the
9th, were the copies of the <i>Western Morning News</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<i>Western Daily Mercury</i> distributed by Sanders along
the line of route on Thursday and Saturday. Among
other damage enormous destruction was done to the
plantation at Blackpool, almost the whole of the young
trees being spoiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawlish.</span>&mdash;During the progress of the storm at Dawlish
on Tuesday, the Ladies' Bathing Pavilion, which
stood on the beach in front of the Marine Parade, was
carried away by the sea, and almost entirely destroyed.
The pavilion was erected by a limited liability company
in 1880, and the annual income accruing from it had
reached between Â£70 and Â£80.   The fishermen and
others of this attractive watering-place sustained great
losses by the destruction of fishing and pleasure boats.
At the Coastguard Station the boathouse was partially
unroofed, and large blocks of granite were hurled a great
distance. As on Plymouth Hoe, the iron seats on
the sea-wall were rolled over and broken. Houses in
various parts of the town lost chimney-tops and slates,
and some large trees, standing in the grounds of the
Manor House, were stripped of their branches. At
Dawlish Water, a cow, belonging to Mr. Dufty, was
killed by a falling tree. Discomfort was experienced by
the few passengers who travelled from Exeter to Dawlish
on the night of Tuesday, by the train which should have
reached the latter town by about eight o'clock. On
reaching the boathouse, near Powderham Castle, a block
in the shape of a snow-drift was encountered, and the
passengers made for a hut which was found not far off,
and a fire being got alight, they remained there until five
o'clock on Wednesday morning, when a relief engine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
snow-plough, with a carriage, arriving, they were conveyed
to their destination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ermington.</span>&mdash;Roads everywhere here were completely
blocked for a week, and neither supplies of provisions,
letters, nor newspapers were received. The farmers were
great sufferers, scores of sheep having been buried in the
snow, which in some places was fifteen feet deep. The
work of digging out the sheep commenced during the
bright weather of Wednesday, when many ewes were
found to be dead, the lambs, in some cases, being found
alive by the side of the dead mothers. Instances were
met with as late as Saturday where sheep got out of the
snow fresh and vigorous, after having been buried since
the Monday. At Kingston, near Ermington, nearly
thirty sheep belonging to one farm were blown into the
sea, and from Ringmore, another village in the same
district, 350 sheep were lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exeter.</span>&mdash;In addition to the interference with railway
traffic, and the collapse of telegraphic communication
between the capital of the county and the other portions
of Devon and of Cornwall that has been already briefly
described, great inconveniences were experienced in the
city and all the surrounding villages through the violence
of the wind and the depth of the drifts of snow. Several
accidents to house property, in the way of falling chimneys
and walls, occurred, but nothing of a particularly
serious nature was heard of. Business was partially suspended,
and the streets were almost entirely deserted.
Great interest was felt in connection with the railway
blocks further west, and various exciting rumours were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
circulated from time to time, many of them being, fortunately,
without foundation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exmouth.</span>&mdash;In the outlying districts in the neighbourhood
of Exmouth, a peculiarity in connection with the late
blizzard that also struck observers in many other parts of
Devon and Cornwall, was very noticeable. This singularity
was that localities, commonly regarded as the most
sheltered, suffered most severely. In such situations the
drifts became impassable, and the cottagers were without
fresh supplies of provisions until footways were cleared
across fields. The narrow lanes were filled with snow.
Near the Littleham Church the drift was so deep, that a
tunnel was made sufficiently wide and high for carts to
pass through. At one part of the road leading from
Lympstone to Withycombe, a lane had to be cut for a
considerable distance, the drift being five or six feet deep.
By the end of the week the Exmouth streets were all
clear, and business was going on much as usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falmouth.</span>&mdash;Some of the disastrous effects of the
blizzard at this sea-port have already been recounted, but
Falmouth was unfortunate in other respects, besides being
the scene of so many wrecks with attendant loss of life.
The weather has been described by residents as the
heaviest experienced in the district since 1853. Scarcely
a house exposed to the gale escaped injury, and in many
cases property suffered severely. Were there space to
record them, innumerable instances could be given of
roofs being blown off, chimneys having fallen, and
marvellous escapes of residents having occurred during
these accidents. At the well-known "Curiosity Shop"
of Mr. Burton, a slate from some opposite premises went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
through a large window, and two vases within, valued at
Â£85, narrowly escaped destruction. The back premises
of Mr. Webber, jeweller, which overlooked the harbour,
were completely washed away, and all the fowls in the
fowl-house were drowned. In the rope-walk several fine
Cornish elms were uprooted, one of them cutting through
a neighbouring roof. Telegraph wires also were broken
by the falling timber, and many huge limbs of trees were
blown down outside Grove Hill. Between Monday
night and noon on Wednesday no train arrived at or left
Falmouth, and telegraphic communication being cut off
the inhabitants knew nothing of what was transpiring in
other parts. It was not until the Saturday evening that
telegraphic communication was re-established with Truro,
and two hours later a wire was got through to London.
Messrs. Fox &amp; Co., shipping agents, having urgent
telegrams to send to London, despatched them via
France and Spain. The London morning papers despatched
on Tuesday reached Falmouth on Saturday
night, by which time postal affairs were commencing to
be put in order. All along the quays the damage to
small craft of every kind was immense, and the shore
was strewn with wreckage and crowded with damaged
boats. At one spot on the market-strand, between the
King's Arms and the establishment of Mr. Grose, a big
sail boat was driven ashore, followed by a coal hulk belonging
to Messrs. Vivian &amp; Sons, the latter knocking down a
wall. The <span class="smcap">s.s.</span> <i>Carbon</i>, belonging to the Falmouth Coal
Company, sank at her moorings in the harbour, and the
Harbour Board's steamer, <i>Armenack</i>, had a narrow escape
of being wrecked. About a dozen well-known residents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had trawlers, sailing-boats, and punts damaged or totally
wrecked, but these form only a small proportion of the
losses by the gale. Among the fishermen distress was
great, and, as already stated on another page, a fund for
their relief was inaugurated without loss of time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fowey.</span>&mdash;At this sea-port very severe weather was
experienced. The whole country round was covered
with snow, and communication by telegraph, except to
Lostwithiel and St. Austell, was impossible. Fowey does
not appear to have experienced much of the effects of the
gale on Monday night and Tuesday, but a strong wind
with snow showers, visited the town on the following
Thursday. There were no casualties, and no great loss
of sheep, as, though many were buried in the snow,
nearly all were recovered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grampound Road.</span>&mdash;Here snow commenced falling
at about noon on Monday, and continued with only a
few minutes' cessation for twenty-four hours. The
blizzard nature of the storm was most severely felt, and
among other distressing events hundreds of sheep were
lost. All telegraphic communication was completely
stopped. The last up-train from Penzance, due at
Grampound Road at about twenty minutes past eight in
the evening, was blocked by the snow a quarter of a mile
west of the station. The passengers were got out, and,
under the guidance of some of the villagers, made their
way across the fields, and took shelter in the hotels.
Strenuous efforts were made to extricate the train, but it
was not until half-past four on the following morning
that the difficult task was accomplished, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
passengers were enabled to proceed on their journey.
The loss of sheep in this district was very great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gunnislake.</span>&mdash;Throughout the whole of Monday
night the blizzard raged in Gunnislake, and only slightly
abated its force on Tuesday. Havoc was spread on
every hand, and in one case a very serious accident, that
narrowly escaped fatal consequences, occurred. This
was at the house of Mr. Bowhay, surgeon, where a
neighbouring chimney crashed through the roof and fell
into the kitchen. Two servants and an infant child were
in the kitchen at the time, and one of the former was
knocked to the floor, and on being extricated was found
to have had her leg broken. The other servant girl and
Mr. Bowhay's child received cuts. On the opposite
side of the road a chimney fell upon a house named
East View, crushing in the end roof of a house in which,
soon after, and in a room immediately below that into
which the rubbish fell, a child was born. Large trees,
over fifty years' old, were rooted up and thrown across
the main thoroughfares. At Drakewell's Mine serious
damage was done to the roofs, and at Heath Cottage,
adjoining the mine, nine tall Scotch firs, which stood
within fifteen feet of each other, were rooted up, and left
lying in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helston.</span>&mdash;At Helston, every road leading to other
towns was blocked up. No newspaper arrived, nor were
any mails sent off until Saturday. Telegraph wires and
poles, and innumerable trees were blown down, the
plantations in the district suffering severely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hemerdon.</span>&mdash;No less than six engines were snowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
up on Monday night in the neighbourhood of Hemerdon,
many of them containing parties despatched from Plymouth
by the Great Western Railway to the relief of the
train that left Millbay Station at 6Â·50 on Monday night,
and was snowed up on a bridge some distance beyond
the Ivybridge Viaduct. In two cases timely rescues
of drivers were effected by Mr. Harold S. Williams, of
Torridge, the story of which will be found related in
a subsequent chapter. One very sad fatality occurred to
the wife of a miner, named Ann Farley. She left
Plympton on Monday afternoon to visit her father at
Hemerdon village, and setting out for her home in the
evening would appear to have lost her way, as her body
was found on Thursday evening in a field at Lobb Farm,
in about three feet of snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honiton.</span>&mdash;In a path field leading from Offwell to
Land Wood, in the Honiton district, on the Sunday
morning following the Monday and Tuesday of the
blizzard, the body of a man named Bidgood was discovered.
It transpired at an inquest subsequently held
that the man was a labourer, who had left work at Gittisham
Hill on Tuesday evening to proceed to his home at
Offwell. After calling at the New Inn, Honiton Hill, he
was not again seen alive. The body was found, lying flat
upon its face, by Mr. F. J. Harford, who was looking for
some sheep. In many places near Honiton the snow
drifts reached to a height of twenty feet, and it was
almost impossible to find the main road. Sheep were
buried in the snow in many parts of the district, and
large trees were rooted up and thrown across the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ilfracombe.</span>&mdash;At Ilfracombe, during Monday night, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
strong gale raged, and the brigantine <i>Ethel</i>, of Salcombe,
went ashore at Combemartin early on Tuesday morning,
and became a total wreck, but the crew were all saved.
The schooner <i>Pride of the West</i>, of Padstow, had her
bowsprit carried away, under Hillsborough, and was
towed into Ilfracombe harbour. Considerable damage
was done to property, and business for a day or two was
suspended. Five large trees were blown down in the
churchyard. The last train from Barnstaple to Ilfracombe
on Monday night was brought to a standstill in
the Burrow cutting, where the snow had reached a great
height. The passengers were got safely out, and proceeded
to the Fortescue Hotel at Morthoe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivybridge.</span>&mdash;A full share of destruction of every kind
was experienced at Ivybridge during the storm. Trees
fell in all directions, a large one breaking in the roof of
the newly constructed Navvy Mission Room. The
Navvy Missioner, Mr. MacLean, was in the room at the
time, and had a very narrow escape. Over a dozen trees
fell between the station and the village, most of them
being uprooted. For some time provisions in the town
showed serious signs of running short, but by a laudable
system of mutual accommodation between the residents
and tradespeople any actual privation was averted.
Several of the passengers by the 6Â·50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> snowed-up
train from Plymouth on Monday night, and the down
night train due at Plymouth about 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Monday
night, also blocked at Ivybridge Station, were located in
the village, but some of the passengers, as late as
Thursday evening, were still in search of lodgings. The
railway guards and drivers were also in dire straits, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Mr. Bohn (the proprietor of the London Hotel), promptly
and generously came to the rescue with free dinners to
the railway servants. Many hundreds of people visited
the scene of the principal block at Langham Bridge,
where the unfortunate train from Plymouth on Monday
night became embedded in a deep snow-drift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kingsbridge.</span>&mdash;This neighbourhood underwent some
wretched experiences, not only during the blizzard of
Monday and Tuesday, but for fully a fortnight subsequent
to the storm.   The roads leading to surrounding
towns were in a terrible condition through the fall of
snow that appears to have exceeded here the fall in any
other part of Devon, and the losses of farm-stock were
very great. The first episode occurred at seven o'clock
on Monday evening, when the mail-cart for Totnes was
snowed up after having proceeded a mile out of Kingsbridge,
and the driver was compelled to return with his
pair of horses, leaving the van in the road. The mail-bags
were brought back to the town on the following
morning. In another case, Mr. Waymouth, of Woolston,
four miles from Kingsbridge, started from the latter place
in his carriage for home on the same evening, but was
stopped by a fallen tree, and he and his coachman were
compelled to take shelter at Coombe Royal, and to
remain there until the following Thursday. There were
the usual instances of damage to house property, and
there was also tremendous destruction to trees, and to
the shrubberies of the various residences in the vicinity
of the town. All communication was cut off from
outside by the destruction of telegraph wires and
posts. The telegraph wires have been described as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
presenting a very singular appearance, the coating of
hardened snow in many instances extending to a thickness
as great as six inches in diameter. No communication
with any other town was received or sent for four
whole days, and the post-office was closed for three
days, as no mails could be received or despatched.
Several commercial travellers who got into the town on
Monday were compelled to remain till Friday, when
they escaped from confinement by going to Plymouth by
steamer. The hardships endured in neighbouring villages
for a week were severe, some of the villagers having
been without coals, and, the bakers having run out of
flour, bread in sufficient quantities could not be
obtained. There was considerable injury to some
of the crops, and almost every farmer lost sheep in
the snow. Mr. Hooppell, of Bigbury, lost between
three and four hundred, the greater number of which
were probably blown into the sea. Mr. J. Langworthy,
of East Allington, lost about seventy sheep and lambs,
computed to be worth Â£300. Mr. S. Square, of Thurlestone,
also lost over 100 valuable sheep and lambs.
One gentleman had the task imposed upon him of
endeavouring to keep alive forty young lambs which
had lost their mothers.</p>

<p>Great havoc was wrought in the grounds of Coombe
Royal, the American garden being laid almost bare.
In the vicarage grounds many of the trees and shrubs
were blown down. Improvised sledges were used
during the second week by residents as well as the local
carriers, these being, indeed, the only vehicles that could
be used with any safety.</p>

<div class="caption">ST. CLEER ROAD, LISKEARD.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Launceston.</span>&mdash;Considerable inconvenience was experienced
in Launceston throughout the week of storm,
but scarcely anything more serious. From Tuesday to
Thursday there was a complete cessation of intercourse
with other parts of the country, no mails being
despatched, or papers or news of any kind being
received, and no telegraphic service was available
throughout the week. Some damage was inflicted by
the wind to both glass and trees, and the roofs of houses
were more or less damaged, but altogether Launceston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was much more fortunate than the majority of west-country
towns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption">COLDSTILE LANE, LISKEARD.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Liskeard.</span>&mdash;The greatest discomforts experienced at
Liskeard were those brought about by the impassable
condition of the roads, and by the blocking of the leat
on Bulland Down, which supplies the town with water.
The reservoirs on St. Cleer Downs were nearly empty
on Wednesday morning, when Mr. Sampson, the inspector
of the water, visited it, and found that an
immense snow-drift was blocking it on the north side of
the down. For nearly twelve hours a gang of men dug
at the drift, and succeeded in freeing the leat and saving
the town from a water famine. The leat was on a very
exposed part of the down, and the height of the snow-drifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in the locality may be judged from the view we
give of one of these. The illustration is from a photograph
kindly supplied by Mr. A. W. Venning, solicitor,
of Liskeard. A horse and cart had been dug out from
this drift just before the photograph was taken. The
town was completely isolated for several days, and the
distress among the poorer inhabitants was very great.
Everything possible was done to mitigate the temporary
distress, relief committees being formed under the active
superintendence of the Mayor of Liskeard&mdash;Mr. T.
Lang. On Friday, after Thursday's snowfall, the rural
postmen could not go their rounds, the height of snow
in the roads being so great. Our view of Coldstile Lane,
near Liskeard (also from a photograph contributed by
Mr. Venning), which was impassable for days, reveals in
a forcible manner the state of this part of Cornwall.
Here, as elsewhere, hundreds of sheep were buried in
the snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lyme Regis.</span>&mdash;One of the heaviest snowstorms that
ever visited the south of Dorset was experienced at Lyme
Regis on Tuesday, March 10th. The town lies six miles
from the nearest railway station, and the only communication
is by two well-appointed three-horse 'busses. On
Tuesday the 'bus, with an extra horse, left the town at
nine in the morning, carrying the mails. The conveyance,
with great difficulty, reached the high hill
known as Hunter's Lodge, where, notwithstanding all
efforts, it was found impossible to proceed further. The
one lady passenger walked to the hotel at Hunter's Lodge,
while the driver, Mr. Blake, rode back to Lyme Regis
and obtained assistance.   By the time the luggage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
mails had been transferred to a light waggonette the 'bus,
except for the roof, was invisible, and the roof was only
kept clear by the strong wind blowing at the time.
Later on the same night, the driver of the mail cart
from Illminster to Lyme started to do the journey on horseback,
driving being out of the question. On about the
same spot as the 'bus had been buried, the driver lost
his horse, and accomplished the rest of the journey on
foot, arriving at Lyme at one o'clock on Wednesday
morning. Both horse and 'bus were eventually recovered,
and the mail carts resumed running on
March 17th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mevagissey.</span>&mdash;The gale of Monday and Tuesday raged
with great fury at Mevagissey, blowing from E.S.E.,
accompanied by blinding snow. On Tuesday morning
the parapet of the new breakwater on the southern
side of the harbour was found to have been washed
off for a distance of two hundred feet, and the sea
was rushing through the gap. By the end of the
week the breakwater was in three parts, and it was feared
that the whole structure would have to be taken down.
The damage was estimated at over Â£10,000. The fishermen
suffered greatly through the loss of herring and
pilchard nets, which were shot at anchor in the bay, and
swept away by the gale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Modbury.</span>&mdash;The blizzard was very destructive in the
Modbury district, and the town was completely isolated
from the Monday to the Saturday. On Monday evening
several farmers who had attended the market and left for
their homes, were driven back, and had to remain in
Modbury several days. The loss of sheep in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was unusually large, it being estimated that
within the postal district of Modbury nearly one thousand
sheep were lost, besides several head of cattle. Some of
the snow-drifts were immense, and one labourer had his
house completely covered. A boy, who had been sent on
Monday to deliver bread at some neighbouring villages,
was discovered in the evening sitting in the trap almost
insensible from cold, while the trap was nearly buried in
the snow. The horse was released, and the boy taken
to the nearest house, where he soon recovered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newquay.</span>&mdash;At Newquay there was a great fall of
snow, and many sheep were buried. Mr. T. Cardell
lost over 100, and other farmers as many as forty each.
A man named Ambrose Matthews, a hawker of wild
flowers, was found dead under three feet of snow in a
field near Tower Lane, where he was probably trying to
crawl into a shed for shelter. He was last seen selling
flowers in the town at half-past eight on Monday night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newton Abbott.</span>&mdash;The greater part of the railway
traffic at Newton Abbott was suspended. The last up-train
that arrived on Monday was the 4Â·30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> express
from Plymouth; and the Monday evening's mails from
Paddington, and Tuesday morning's Bristol and Newton
Abbott travelling post-office, which arrived several hours
late, were unable to proceed further than this town, and
about one hundred passengers were compelled to remain
in Newton. There was, in the streets, an average depth
of three feet of snow, whilst in some places the drifts
were from ten to twelve feet in height. Considerable
damage was done to the trees and shrubs in the park,
and in the private gardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padstow.</span>&mdash;This was another town that suffered very
severely. Great quantities of unexpected snow fell, and
the gale was terrific on Monday night and all day on
Tuesday. People who were out of town on the Monday
night had great difficulty in returning to their homes,
and one woman, named Rebecca Chapman, did not
succeed, but was found buried in the snow on the
following Sunday. Miss Chapman, of about sixty-two
years of age, who resided at Crugmere, about a mile-and-a-half
from Padstow, had been in the latter town on
Monday, and left for home at about seven o'clock in the
evening. At a place named Trethillick she lost her way,
and calling at one of the houses in the village was put
upon the right road. She was never again seen alive.
On perceiving on Tuesday that the woman was not at
home, the neighbours raised an alarm, and search parties
were instituted, but the body was not recovered until the
following week. From the position of the body when
found, it would seem that the unfortunate woman had
mistaken the gate of the field in which she was lying for
that of her own home, and, entering the field, had fallen
exhausted. Her basket, containing the provisions she
had bought in the town, was found lying beside her.
When the storm was at its fiercest, on Monday evening,
the dandy <i>Louisa</i>, of Exeter, in entering Padstow harbour,
ran into the schooner <i>Ballanheigh Castle</i>, and damaged
her galley and bulwarks. A praam, weighing nearly a
ton, which was lying keel upwards on the quay, was
caught during one of the squalls, and carried completely
over the quay. On many farms large numbers of sheep
were buried, but in most cases these were rescued alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paignton.</span>&mdash;Great damage was done at Paignton on
Monday night and Tuesday. The roof of one wing of the
house of Sir Thomas Seccombe, K.C.S.I., on Coninence,
was blown in, and crashed through the building, but nobody
was hurt. In the Totnes-road the roof of Miss
Scale's house was blown off, and several trees were blown
down. The landing-stage of the Promenade Pier was
washed away, and the sea-wall front of Redcliff Tower
undermined. The Artillery Volunteer ammunition shed
was completely wrecked. A tall elm at Dr. Goodridge's
residence fell over and nearly crushed the roof. Steam
launches were much injured, and several fishermen lost
their boats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Penzance.</span>&mdash;During Monday night's storm, at Penzance,
there was such a terrific sea running that the
north dock gate was unhung, and much damage was
occasioned to the shipping in the port. Some of the
most beautiful trees in the vicinity were ruined. On the
following Tuesday the storm continued, and business
almost entirely ceased, no shops being opened for the
day. There was a good deal of anxious looking out for
the return of travellers who had left the town before the
commencement of the storm on Monday, but by degrees
they either returned or their whereabouts was ascertained.
At Wheal Vor, Breage, however, a woman,
sixty years of age, perished in the snow. Supplies of
food were almost daily fetched by boat from Penzance
for little fishing villages in the district, and a small coasting
steamer was chartered to take in a stock of provisions
and land it on the sands at Porthcurno, just within sight
of Logan Rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plympton.</span>&mdash;At Plympton, matters were very serious.
Hundreds of trees were destroyed, and large numbers of
sheep died from exposure and starvation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="450" height="308" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CHURCH, AND CHAPLAIN'S HOUSE, PRINCETOWN, DARTMOOR.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Princetown.</span>&mdash;This moorland town passed through
some trying experiences during the storm week. The
roofs of several cattle and sheep-sheds were blown away,
and every house in the neighbourhood suffered considerable
damage. A part of the church roof was unslated,
and the church itself, and the chaplain's house, were
almost buried in the snow. An illustration shows the
condition of these two buildings, for the photographic
views of which, as well as for the picture of the convicts
cutting a road, we have to thank Mr. J. Richards, clerk
of works at the convict establishment, who took a great
number of interesting views of extraordinary scenes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
met with after the blizzard. At the Prison Officers'
School, some four or five of the moor children had to
be detained all night, fires being lighted and hot
provisions provided. The block on the Princetown
railway line, where the evening train had been snowed
up on Monday evening, was a very serious one, and
it took a gang of fifty men and a snow-plough several
days to work through the accumulated mass. The inhabitants
were without letter, paper, or telegram from Monday
morning until Saturday, when the postmaster, Mr. W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Tooker, with the rural letter-carrier, and a prison officer,
Mr. Rodway, who accompanied the party as a volunteer,
risked a walk to Yelverton. There they found twenty-five
bags of mails awaiting them. They succeeded in
walking back to Princetown, taking with them fourteen
bags of mails and a small quantity of newspapers, and
were received with much enthusiasm. No fear was felt
that provisions would fail at the prison, as there was a
large stock on hand, but it was deemed advisable to kill
a number of sheep and pigs belonging to the farm. The
roads were cleared after immense labour, some of this
work being carried out by convicts from the prison.</p>

<div class="caption">CONVICTS CUTTING A ROAD AT PRINCETOWN, DARTMOOR.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Redruth.</span>&mdash;On the Monday and Tuesday at Redruth
there was such a storm as had not been known for thirty-five
years in West Cornwall. It snowed almost incessantly
for twenty-four hours, and left drifts, in some parts,
from ten to twelve feet deep. The trains could not get
into Redruth either from east or west for two days, and
even Camborne could not be reached. Trees in various
parts were much injured. There was little business done,
and the quantity of provisions brought into the town being
so small, the prices were of the most extravagant description.
Milk could hardly be obtained, and what butter
was in the market was sold at the price of 2s. per lb., a
heavy price for Redruth. There was a scarcity of coals
in the neighbourhood, and the stock (of coals) at the
brewery was exhausted before the end of the week.
Most of the roads in the district were impassable, and
it was found impossible as late as Friday to dig out the
vehicles that Monday's storm embedded in the Redruth
highway. Mining operations were greatly impeded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
tunnels in the snow having in some instances to be cut to
enable the miners to get to their work. There were many
rumours of persons missing since the memorable Monday,
and fears for their safety were entertained which in one
unhappy case proved to be only too well grounded. A
boy named Wallace left his work at the Wheal Basset
mine on the afternoon of the storm to walk to his home.
He did not reach it at the usual time, nor at all on that
day, and great anxiety resulted, search parties scouring
the country in all directions. At length, ten days afterwards,
his body was found in a snow-drift between thirty
and forty yards from his home. Another lad had a very
narrow escape. He was missed for some hours, and
was found almost unconscious in an outhouse, where he
had taken refuge under some straw. Not the least serious
inconvenience attending this week of disaster at Redruth
was the unavoidable postponement of a number of
funerals, to make way to the parish church and cemetery
being found impracticable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Columb.</span>&mdash;The advent of the blizzard at St.
Columb was sudden and unexpected, and the force of
the wind drifted most of the snow into the roads and
hedges in such a way as to completely stop all vehicular
traffic. In some spots the drifts were fifteen feet high.
No letters or papers arrived in the town from Monday
until Wednesday evening, and among other inconveniences
was the unavoidable postponement of a wedding
which was to have taken place. As this event was
not fixed for any earlier date than the last day of the
week, and could not take place then, some idea of the
condition of the country may be formed. The farmers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
were apparently taken by surprise, as most of their
sheep were out, and hundreds were buried beneath the
snow. Many lambs and sheep were found at a depth
of seven or eight feet, and instances occurred of lambs,
who had been born under circumstances such as these,
being found alive and healthy. Buried houses were
by no means an uncommon occurrence. At Winnard's
Perch, about two miles from Redruth, a woman was
snowed in from Monday until Wednesday at noon,
when she was dug out. Great damage was also done
to trees, and for a time business was suspended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Ives.</span>&mdash;A tempestuous sea was the chief cause of
suffering at St. Ives. The blizzard blew mainly from
the E.N.E., and caused sad havoc along the coast on
Monday night and Tuesday. Ships in positions of
peril were occasionally observed, and the lifeboat crew,
with rocket apparatus, held themselves in readiness,
and in some cases, endeavoured to get near the endangered
vessels, but the tracks to the shore were impassable.
The window of a cottage on the Warren,
overlooking the sea, was blown in, and the sea rushed in
and partly filled one of the rooms. Slates and chimneypots
were blown about to the imminent danger of the
inhabitants. A man named Metters left St. Ives for
St. Just, with a donkey cart, on Monday, to sell herrings,
and after nearly a week's absence his friends gave him
up for lost, but he returned to his home on the following
Monday, having been snowed up at St. Just for the
entire week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sennen.</span>&mdash;The Land's End district was altogether cut
off from other parts of the country from Monday to Friday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and even after that time communication was only
effected with great difficulty. The snow-drifts were
immense, and many sheep and lambs were buried.
Supplies having begun to fail by the end of the week,
a shopkeeper inaugurated a novel expedition which,
grotesque as it was in its make-up and appearance,
succeeded in the object the organizer had in view. He
obtained a number of donkeys, and having placed
baskets upon their backs, formed them into procession,
he leading the way with a shovel, with which he cleared
a path to St. Just. There provisions were obtained, and
the adventurous tradesman, followed by his donkeys,&mdash;now
laden with well-filled baskets,&mdash;returned triumphant
to St. Sennen. Two cottages near the Land's End were
buried in the snow, and the cottagers had to be dug out.
The Rev. J. Isabell, of St. Sennen, by way of getting
the roads clear, set an admirable example. He headed
a party of some seventy men, all being armed with
shovels, and effected good work in making the parish
roads fit for traffic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taunton.</span>&mdash;The train due at Taunton at seven
minutes past nine and the "Flying Dutchman" reached
Taunton at about the same time on Monday night, and
were unable to proceed further. Among the passengers
was the Duke of Edinburgh, on his way to Devonport,
who was detained for some few days, after which he was
enabled to reach Exeter, and from thence to proceed
without further mishap to his destination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tavistock.</span>&mdash;Some account of the devastation caused
in this district by the storm has already been given. The
destruction to timber was especially heavy, but perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the most serious feature of all is the loss of sheep and
cattle. Mr. H. Dingle, of Taviton, had over two hundred
sheep embedded in the snow, and a number of these
were taken out dead. Mr. Perkins, of King-street,
Tavistock, and Mr. Walkem, of Hartshole, also suffered
heavily in this respect. On the estate of the Rev. J.
Hall-Parby there was also a great loss of sheep. Out of
sixteen sheep buried in a drift, nine, belonging to Mr.
Warne, were dug out dead, while in the neighbouring
parish of Walkhampton the loss was still greater. Mr.
Giles, of this parish, dug out 40 dead sheep. Mr. J.
Squire, of the Bedford Hotel, had a flock of sheep and
lambs buried in the snow, on his moorland farm on
Whitchurch Down, but he succeeded in rescuing most of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teignmouth.</span>&mdash;The destruction wrought on the sea-front
of this well-known watering-place and sea-port,
which has been briefly alluded to in earlier pages,
appears to have had the effect of waking up the residents
to a sense of the innumerable natural beauties that belong
to their town, and the advisability of preserving, and,
if possible, improving them. Not many months before
the blizzard of 1891, a gale from the south-east was near
demolishing that portion of the bank above the beach,
that has since fallen before the action of the waves, and
from time to time the dangerous position of the houses
abutting upon it, and standing within a stone's-throw
of the sea, has been pointed out by a large number of
the residents themselves. Nature has now taken the
matter in hand, and the probabilities are that a sea-wall
will be built that will extend from the "Point," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
lighthouse, to the Hole Head tunnel, a distance of over
a mile and a half, and thus the finest sea promenade
in the country will be secured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torquay.</span>&mdash;The snowstorm was more severe at Torquay
than at any of the surrounding districts, the fall
having been heavier than at either Teignmouth or
Dawlish. Few mishaps occurred, however, and there
was not any really serious damage. Railway communication
with Exeter, London, and the north, was never
interrupted. Some injuries to trees occurred, and a few
telegraph posts were blown down, but, on the whole,
Torquay sustained its reputation as a desirable winter
abode.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Totnes.</span>&mdash;Some novel incidents occurred at Totnes
during the week of the storm. The town was for days
completely isolated, the only journey possible in search
of news appearing to have been a perilous one, on foot,
to Brent, where ignorance of the doings of the outside
world was as great, if not greater, than at Totnes itself.
A number of travellers, among them Mr. H. S. Jenkins, of
the <i>Western Morning News</i> (who had gone to the town on
duty on the Monday night), were detained until the end
of the week, and all the inconveniences resulting from
an enforced imprisonment of such an unusual description
were experienced. The first indication of an actual block
on the railway was at about nine o'clock on Monday night,
when the down-train, due at Plymouth at ten o'clock,
arrived at Totnes station, and was not allowed to proceed,
as no communication could be exchanged with stations
further down the line. After hours of waiting, some of the
passengers sheltering themselves in the carriages and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in the waiting-room (where they were made as comfortable
as circumstances would allow, Miss Inskip keeping
the refreshment-room open until four o'clock on Tuesday
morning), all were compelled to take up their quarters in
the town for what was to them, at that time, a very indefinite
period. There were, in the neighbourhood of
Totnes, great losses among the farming community,
hundreds of sheep being buried in the snow. One
farmer, of Ashprington, dug out a flock of fifty, of which
fifteen were dead. Orchards were completely wrecked,
and many fine forest trees were destroyed. In the town
the damage done to property was not very great, but the
glass roofs of several conservatories were broken in by
the weight of snow. The snow in the streets was three
feet deep, and in the adjacent country roads a depth of
from six to eight feet was recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Truro.</span>&mdash;At the cathedral city of Cornwall trade was
at a complete standstill for days, owing to the heavy fall
of snow. Snow lay three feet deep in all the roads outside
the town, and, going farther into the country, the
drifts were from ten to twelve feet deep. Great damage
was done to property, and some accidents, none of them,
however, having a fatal termination, occurred. To make
matters worse for those having business matters to look
after, the train service was altogether disorganised. The
"Dutchman" arrived on Monday night forty minutes late,
and then had to wait the arrival of the train from Falmouth.
This, due at Truro at 7Â·25, did not arrive until
ten minutes to nine. Its course was blocked by fallen
telegraph poles and wires, which had to be cut away
before the train could proceed, the most serious obstacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
being between Penryn and Perranwell. The "Dutchman"
had to pass by Grampound Road at full speed, or it
would probably have been in danger of being embedded
in the snow. It was only when the end of this memorable
week had been reached that telegraphic and other
communication with neighbouring towns was restored,
and that the city once more returned to its usual condition
of comfort and tranquillity.</p>

IN PARK AND FOREST.</h2>


<p>There is no stronger testimony to the overwhelmingly
destructive character of the blizzard of March, 1891, than
that afforded by the spectacle of thousands of forest trees,
that had, in numerous instances, withstood the storms of
centuries, lying, some with their roots above ground,
others snapped short off or twisted asunder, but all
mercilessly and hopelessly wrecked. Many of these fallen
monarchs had experienced heavier gales undoubtedly,
but they had not been so rapidly laden with the heavy
burden of clinging snow that caused them to sway and
stagger, and rendered them helpless victims to the fury
of the blast. The effects of this blizzard-like nature of
the storm are apparent in the peculiar form the havoc in
the parks and forests has assumed&mdash;some trees appearing
as if the tops had been wrenched off, and in other instances
a trunk being left standing&mdash;a mere bare pole&mdash;denuded
of all its branches. Many trees that were old and feeble
weathered the storm best, the apparent cause being that
their stronger brethren sheltered them from the fatal
garment of snow as much as from the gale, and that
when the protector at last fell the fury of the blast was
spent.</p>

<p>The manner in which the snow clung to, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
fell upon, all objects that it encountered, is strikingly
shown in the accompanying illustration of Membland
after the storm. The illustration is from a photograph
of a water-colour drawing. The photograph, and the
following narrative, have been courteously supplied to
us by one who was a deeply interested spectator of
the scene:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Membland, Lord Revelstoke's place ten miles from
Plymouth at the mouth of the Yealm, the devastation
and havoc caused by the storm of the 9th of March are
indescribable.</p>

<p>"The appearance of the house on the Wednesday
following, the 11th, will not easily be forgotten by its
inmates. That Wednesday was a glorious day of sunshine.
The house was entirely, to all appearance, snowed
up to the top storey; the wind in its fierceness having
flung the snow against the house, where it froze on the
windows, giving a weird look; a pane of glass here and
there coming out in relief, and prismatic colours darting
across, in and out of the snow where the sun shone in
full power.</p>

<p>"Where the ivy covers the north side, the effect was
very beautiful: each leaf covered as it were with a bell
of crystal, and festoons of crystal hanging down in every
direction. Outside the front door the snow was fourteen
feet deep. From eight to ten on that memorable Monday
evening when the storm was at its height, the gardener,
Mr. Baker, stood out and saw the trees right and left,
here rooted up, there felled down with the rapidity and
report of a volley of musketry. Over a thousand trees
are down, among them the finest trees surrounding the
house, and which can ill be spared, such as the Insignis,
the Ilex, &amp;c. Every orchard is laid low.</p>

<div class="caption">MEMBLAND, RESIDENCE OF LORD REVELSTOKE, AFTER THE STORM.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"The two plantations near the house present the
appearance of hundreds of trees felled down for the
advance of an invading and cruel enemy. On the
carriage-drive you come across a huge tree torn up by
the roots, leaving the whole road cracked as from an
earthquake! By the side of this devastation, at every
turn, you see the most curious sight of all,&mdash;a tree frail
from age or extreme youth left untouched! The
drift at the lodge was from fifteen to twenty feet deep.
The lodge-keeper took one hour and three-quarters
getting from the lodge to the house, on Tuesday, the 10th;
a distance under three-quarters of a mile. Mr. Methyrell,
a tenant of Lord Revelstoke's, residing one mile from
Membland, lost fifty of his sheep. Lord Revelstoke was
fortunate in not losing more than seventeen sheep and
one black lamb. The village of Noss Mayo, situated in
the estuary of the Yealm, in the parish of Revelstoke, has
sadly lost in beauty and picturesqueness from the
destruction of trees, these falling headlong in some
instances on the boats of the inhabitants, and causing
distress and ruin.</p>

<p>"Lord Revelstoke was in London&mdash;Lady Revelstoke
was alone in the house with her niece, Miss Bulteel: the
experience of being cut off from all communication with
the neighbouring villages, the impossibility of procuring
the services of Dr. Adkins were it a matter of life or
death, the cessation of all postal or telegraphic communications,
being told the last portion of flour was exhausted&mdash;this
lasting from Monday until Saturday&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the different incidents arising from this "<i>Great Unforeseen</i>"
are recollections which will never be effaced
from the memories of the inhabitants of the parish of
Revelstoke. The postman from Plymouth to Yealmpton
and Newton Ferrers, including the parish of Revelstoke,
deserves praise. His return was looked for
anxiously by the inhabitants of Noss Mayo and Newton,
morning after morning. He got to Yealmpton, and
sallied forth like the dove after the flood to try and find
his way to Newton, but was forced to turn back. He
succeeded on the Saturday, and was hailed with
delight.</p>

<p>"At Flete, Mr. Mildmay's place, three-and-a-half miles
from Ivybridge, the damage is great, but the loss of
trees not as irreparable as in other places. The family
were away. But the snug little corner between Flete and
Membland, at the mouth of the Erme, inhabited by Mr.
Bulteel, was a haven chosen by this merciless blast upon
which to vent its worst fury. The peaceful valley strewn
with trees, and the beautiful laurels shattered.</p>

<p>"A little incident is worth recording to illustrate the
friendliness and kind-heartedness of the neighbours.
The town of Modbury is six miles from Pamflete. Mr.
Bulteel has for years dealt with Mr. Coyte, the
butcher. On Thursday, the 12th, Mr. Coyte feared Mr.
Bulteel might run short of butcher's-meat; he accordingly
started three men at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> from Modbury, one man carrying
a basket of meat, and the other two with shovels, for
places found too impassable to ensure a footway.</p>

<p>"These men reached Pamflete (Mr. Bulteel's) at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
after a struggle of ten hours to get there. It is needless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to say they were welcomed by Mr. Bulteel, who was
thoroughly grateful to Mr. Coyte for his kind thought."</p>

<p>Another account says:&mdash;"At Mount Edgcumbe Park,
the principal seat of the Rt. Hon. Earl of Mount Edgcumbe,
the wreck to the timber is enormous. So large
are the gaps made in the groups and avenues of trees,
that the unaccustomed open spaces are distinctly visible
from Plymouth Hoe, and from even greater distances.
Altogether, the Earl estimates his loss at two thousand
trees (at Mount Edgcumbe alone), and calculates that it
will take two years to sufficiently clear his park of fallen
timber to enable him to again throw it open to visitors."</p>

<p>The reproduction of a photograph by Mr. Heath, of
George-street, Plymouth, shows the entrance to Mount
Edgcumbe Park. Here there are down three fine elms,
each four hundred years old. One fell right across the
path, the other two fell towards the lodge, which they
only escaped by a few inches, the branches even sweeping
off some of the slates from the roof of the building.
Had the trees fallen but a little more to the north, the
lodge must have been crushed like cardboard. All the
way up the avenue leading to the house the trees are
lying in every direction. In the private garden behind
the house (the favourite resort of the Earl and his family),
the beautiful cedars, known only to those who have had
the privilege of visiting this retired spot, are all down or
shivered where they stand. Particularly and painfully
noticeable are a fine old lime, a chestnut tree, and a
beautiful Turkey oak, not only rooted up but split to
pieces. These the Earl describes as having been his
favourite trees.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the hill overlooking the ruins of the old castle, all
but one of the umbrella pines, so well known to all
visitors to the park, are rooted up, and scattered. In
the laurel walk, dozens of fine trees are down, quite
obstructing the pathway, but the saddest scene of all in
this portion of the park is the fall of a fine silver beech,
which stood just at the end of the walk. Strange to say,
this tree has fallen in the opposite direction to every
tree in the park, as if its sole purpose had been to crush
a beautiful camellia tree that stood exactly opposite, and
that has yearly yielded a thousand blooms. Close by is
still standing a fir, the tallest tree in all the park, looking
as though, through all the stormy night and day, it had
reared its proud head in defiance of the tempest.</p>

<p>"The greatest havoc of all is in that part of the park
known as Beechwood, situated on a slope facing almost
due east. This slope was exposed to the full fury of the
gale, and quite four hundred trees were blown down.
Our illustration, from a photo by Mr. Heath, pourtrays
some of this fallen grandeur. A gardener, who lives in
Beechwood Cottage, far more familiarly known as Lady
Emma's Cottage, relates, that on Monday night, when
the storm was at its height, which was between half-past
seven and eight o'clock, he with his wife and young
family were in the house in an awful state of suspense
and apprehension. Momentarily they were dreading
that a fallen tree would crush in their cottage, and yet
they dared not venture out among the crashing timber,
nor face the blast that would in all probability have
blown them over the cliff into the sea. Their terror can
be well understood when it is stated that from time to time
the branches of falling trees actually brushed the walls of
the cottage. As if by a merciful dispensation of Providence,
a huge beech, standing almost due east to the
house, remained standing, while other trees, less exposed,
were blown down. If the beech had fallen, the fate of
the cottage with its inmates must have been quickly
determined.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the English and Italian gardens more disastrous
wreckage meets the view. On the lawn, in the English
garden, a splendid cork tree, and also a famous holly,
were uprooted. The orangery in the Italian garden
narrowly escaped damage by a falling elm."</p>

<p>Many of the large trees, lying prostrate, and others
completely wrecked, are depicted in the accompanying
view, also from a photo by Mr. Heath.</p>

<p>Seriously as the noble owner of Mount Edgcumbe
suffered at his principal seat, that was not, however, the
extent of the calamity. The condition of the woods
was described by one who visited the locality after the
storm in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Cotehele, the devastation in the woods is
beyond all description. Few, indeed, except the very
oldest persons, have ever been able to see Cotehele
House from the town of Calstock. This historic
mansion is now, however, in full view, and the
monarchs of the wood have fallen low to the extent of
thousands. It is only as one goes through the woods
that the vastness of the destruction can be comprehended.
In the glade that fronts the house towards the Tamar,
below the ornamental pond, the crash and fall has been
so great as to make a tangled mass of roots, branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and limbs. Most of the trees that are down are elms,
though beeches, ashes, and sycamores have also given
way to the gale. Oaks have held on at the roots, but
the limbs have suffered, and firs have gone by the board.
Most of this species of tree have broken short off, rather
than have been uprooted. The beautiful walk from
Cotehele Quay to the house is a wreck that fifty years
will not set in the same form as it existed before the 9th
of March. Trees three feet through have been blown
out of the ground as though they had been saplings, and
in some cases the weight of the earth and stones around
the roots must have been several tons." Not less than
two thousand trees were blown down in Cotehele Woods,
representing over 100,000 feet of timber. One tree alone
contained over two hundred cubic feet.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. W. Coulter, the highly respected house-steward
of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, at Cotehele, and who
resides in Cotehele House, has favoured us with the
following graphic account of what took place during the
early part of this eventful week:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wind, having blown a gale the whole day, continued
to increase in violence as evening approached,
and from 7 till 9 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, accomplished, if not all,
the greater part of the devastation to house and woods.
The noise of the storm resembled the frantic yells and
fiendish laughter of millions of liberated maniacs, broken,
at frequent intervals, by what sounded like deafening
and rapid volleys of heavy artillery, and, as these died
away, louder and louder again rose the appalling screams
of the storm, with slight intervals of lull and perfect
calm, only to return with tenfold violence, which made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the whole house tremble and vibrate. At 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> two
heavy skylights were blown from their position on the
roof of the kitchen, and from the chimney of the same
building a huge metal plate was hurled into the court
below, carrying the masonry through the roof and into
the room underneath.</p>

<p>"Several of the windows facing the east were swept in
as easily as a spider's web; lead and glass, scattered
all over the room, leaving only the shattered frames,
through which rushed the resistless wind and blinding
snow. One window, being almost new, the hinges and
fastenings were snapped asunder like joints of thread,
the snow lying in heavy wreaths over beds, furniture,
and floor. Most of the windows on the weather-side
were more or less broken evidently, in the first instance,
by the scattered branches of fallen trees just in front of
the house. Through the joints of doors and windows the
cracks and crevices, before unknown to the eye, the
drifting snow penetrated and piled up in ridges, so that
rooms and passages had to be cleared like the pavement
in the streets.</p>

<p>"It is absolutely impossible to picture the scene of
desolation revealed at daybreak on the morning of the
10th all round the house. The ground was strewn and
literally covered with fallen slates and branches of trees.
The appearance of the courtyard, or quadrangle, presented
that of a grave-yard, the slates in all shapes, sizes,
and forms, standing on end, like grave-stones projecting
above the snow.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the great number of huge trees
levelled all round the house, neither the inmates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Cotehele, nor a single individual outside, once heard the
crash of falling timber above the fierce howling of the
blast.</p>

<p>"We inside the house, at much risk, and after much
labour, managed to find and secure the displaced skylights,
and from that time, 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> till 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, we were
hard at work clearing rooms of the snow and barricading
broken windows with whatever material came first to
hand, such as packing-cases, door-mats, old books and
cardboard, battened firmly into the granite mullions.
Many times during the fierce cannonade we feared the
whole building would collapse, but beyond shattered
windows and roof, the granite walls remain intact, and
during the storm fires had to be extinguished, smoke
and flames being driven into the room and the occupants
driven out.</p>

<p>"A somewhat remarkable incident in reference to this
may here be recorded. Perched on the extreme point
of an abrupt and precipitous rock, overhanging the river
Tamar, stands the venerable old fane, better known as
Sir Richard Edgcumbe's Chapel. Right and left of the
building, nearly the whole of the timber was levelled,
but the Chapel itself and a small clump of sturdy oaks
surrounding the spot are, with the building, left intact,
save one small insignificant tree whose roots and fangs
were clinging to an almost barren piece of rock.</p>

<div class="caption">A FALLEN MONARCH, COTEHELE, CALSTOCK.</div>
</div>

<p>"On an examination of the Cotehele Woods, the scene
presented gives one the idea of an earthquake rather
than that of a storm. The majority of the hundreds
of trees vary from two to three hundred years and
even older, torn up by the roots, and tearing up like so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
much turf yards of macadamized road and huge blocks
of strong stone walls, leaving their ponderous roots
standing erect, to which may be seen clinging several
tons of huge rock firmly clasped by root and soil, and
in many instances, these giants of the forest are found
lying athwart each other, shewing the storm to have
practised all the antics of a whirlwind." A huge fallen
tree, lying prone across a pathway in the woods, may be
seen in the above illustration, which is from a photograph
taken by Mr. Rowe, public librarian, Devonport.</p>

<p>A description of another scene of melancholy devastation,
written in April, some weeks after the storm,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"At Maristowe, the seat of the Right Hon. Sir Massey
Lopes, Bart., the storm did irreparable damage on
Monday. The grounds presented on Tuesday a scene
of terrible desolation, and even now it can be seen that
the beauties of Maristowe are all destroyed. Mr. Merson,
steward to Sir Massey, states that fifty thousand trees are
down, and that the respected owner is much affected by
his loss. Nearly all the lime trees in the avenue leading
from the croquet and tennis lawns to the garden, and
which formed the chief attraction to visitors, are lying in
hopeless confusion, and the avenue, considered the most
beautiful walk in all Devonshire, is now utterly impassable
and destroyed for ever. In the main coach
road, from the gamekeeper's lodge to the mansion, fifty
beautiful beeches have fallen.</p>

<p>"The greatest portion of the damage within the park
itself, occurred in the immediate vicinity of Mr. Merson's
house, the occupants of which expected every moment
that it would be crushed by falling trees.</p>

<p>"A strange incident occurred in connection with the
sycamore trees. It appears that on the Saturday
previous to the storm Sir Massey decided that two old
and decayed trees of this kind, which were somewhat in
the way of contemplated improvements to the steward's
residence, should be cut down, and gave Mr. Merson
instructions accordingly. The gale came on, and
hundreds of stately trees, one a monarch elm of unusual
size, and another a stately macrocarphus fir, sixty feet
high, and of exceptional beauty, succumbed within a
short distance of the spot where the two old and despised
sycamores still reared their heads. The storm could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
not destroy them, but they have since been sawn down.
Near this same spot some very choice laurels and
rhododendrons were torn up by the roots and hurled
fifty yards away, being discovered days afterwards buried
under from twelve to twenty feet of snow. In the fir
wood, facing the mansion, on the opposite side of the
Tavy, quite half the trees are blown down, while the
plantation close to the main entrance on Roborough
Down is almost entirely destroyed. The plantation
adjoins the residence of Dr. Clay, of Plymouth, and
contained about three thousand very fine firs and pines
of which only about one hundred remain.</p>

<p>"Looking towards the woods opposite Maristowe House,
the owner must witness such a wreck as never was before
seen since the house has stood there. From the entrance
of the road from Beer Ferris to Lopwell, trees of every
description lie twisted and thrown in every direction, and
the road itself must, for some time, be only available for
traffic with care. The great trees in falling have crashed
through others, and thousands of broken limbs are
visible on every hand. On the other side of the Tavy
towards Denham Bridge, the damage is great, and in the
hollows, here and there, more than three weeks after the
storm, were considerable quantities of snow. At Denham
Bridge several very fine firs have gone, broken off short
some five to eight feet above the ground in most cases,
and in the Tavy here and there are other trees. On the
road from Beer Alston to Tavistock one plantation of
black firs, consisting of several hundred trees, has lost
to the extent of nine trees out of every ten, and the cutoff
ends of the trees jutting on the highway present a
remarkable appearance. A little further away, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
road to Milton Abbot, another fir plantation has nearly
every tree down."</p>

<p>At Buckland Abbey, famous as the ancestral home of
Sir Francis Drake, the ruin is singularly disastrous.
Messrs. Ward &amp; Chowen, of Burnville, Bridestowe, have
kindly forwarded an interesting communication which
sets forth vividly some startling results of the blizzard.

<p>"As agents to the Buckland Abbey property, our Mr.
Chowen visited the Abbey on the Saturday after the
storm, that being the first day it was possible to arrive
at the nearest station, namely, Horrabridge, and in
getting to the Abbey he had to walk over fifteen feet of
snow in some parts, the average depth being about
five feet. On reaching the North Lodge, he was astounded
at the devastation which met his view. The
whole of the Rookery between the North and South
Lodges at the back of the farm-house, commonly
known as Place Barton, was literally levelled&mdash;scarcely
a tree remained standing, and the few that were left were
completely shattered, partly by the storm, and partly by
the falling of the other trees in their sudden descent.</p>

<p>"The fine old timber around the Abbey, which doubtless
gave character to the place in the renowned Sir
Francis Drake's time, has been more or less ruthlessly
torn up by the roots by the effects of the disastrous
storm, and a noble avenue of beech to the north of the
Abbey grounds has suffered terribly, almost every alternate
tree having succumbed. In the Abbey grounds, an
interesting sycamore, centuries old, on the stock of which,
at the point where the branches diverged, accommodation
was afforded by seats and a centre table for a quiet tea-party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
shared the fate of the others, and in its terrific
descent crushed down another fine ornamental specimen
as if it were a sapling. Many of the fine old cedars
have been sadly mutilated, whilst some of the tulip trees
have been destroyed, but the Abbey buildings have,
most fortunately, escaped injury.</p>

<p>"Our Mr. Stevenson, at the North Lodge, has recounted
a marvellous incident which took place on the
Monday evening of the storm. It appears a neighbouring
farmer and his wife paid a visit to their friends at the
Barton, and discovering that the storm was increasing in
violence, decided to leave early. In passing through the
Rookery towards the North Lodge, the way by the South
Lodge being already inaccessible, they had arrived just
where the Rookery terminated at this point, when down
came the last tree over them without warning, and, marvellous
to relate, the horse, conveyance, and occupants
were imprisoned between the large branches diverging
from the stock without the slightest damage whatever
being done. After great difficulty in clearing the branches,
the party were rescued, but could get no further than the
lodge, the horse having to be put up in the kitchen or
living room, whilst the owners were accommodated in
the sitting room, where they remained until the following
Wednesday at midday. Immediately after this occurrence,
the whole Rookery was swept down, completely
covering the road which had been so recently passed
over, and one of the trees was blown on the back roof of
the farm-house, crushing in one of the bedrooms to
within six inches of where a child was sleeping.</p>

<p>"In tracing the ravages of the storm it is most interesting
to notice the vagaries of the current, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
affected everything with which it came in contact. In
some cases the force would appear to descend vertically
in gusts, seizing the top or tops of trees lying together
and wrenching off the same as if turnip-tops, leaving the
stock intact; whilst other trees within a few feet escaped
untouched. Undoubtedly the force of the gale assumed
a variety of forms. In some cases it could be seen that
the extreme violence of the wind reached a breadth of
an eighth of a mile, more or less, when in other places it
was only a few yards wide, clearing everything before it.
In other parts it assumed a circular or vortex form, and
in its tortuous route decimated everything in its way,
tearing up huge trees, as if telegraph poles, and even
stripping off the thick bark of the Scotch fir, leaving it
as clean as a rinded pole.</p>

<p>"So far as we know the buildings have pretty well
escaped, only partial damage being done, and in some
instances trees which might have smashed down dwelling-houses
have been spared, whilst those immediately around
the building have been stranded."</p>

<p>The Rev. Frederic T. W. Wintle, rector of Beerferris,
who, in addition to severe damage to his residence
suffered considerably from loss of trees, contributes the
following information which was written on the Wednesday
after the blizzard:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The barometer on Monday morning at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> had
risen from 29Â·60 on Sunday to 29Â·70. About 12 noon
slight snow began and continued, but did not lie much
until towards evening; the gale freshened towards sunset,
and at 7Â·30 was furious. One of my chimney-stacks fell
at that time, wrecking the roof and three rooms, and it
blew a hurricane for some hours, with blinding drifts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fine snow. I dreaded daylight, but was quite unprepared
for the horrible desolation around me. I had some fine
fir trees, and others, almost everyone was blown down;
and oak trees either uprooted or boughs twisted and
broken in a remarkable way. I have nineteen good
trees all down, and twenty apple trees in an adjacent
orchard. Indeed, my garden, of which I was justly
proud, is completely wrecked and ruined. The barometer
had fallen to 29Â·20 yesterday (Tuesday) morning, and
there was a high wind and fine snow partly falling, partly
drifting, till after dark. The average depth is from five
to seven inches, but deep drifts all about, five feet at
least. This morning (Wednesday) we have a cloudless
sky, calm, and barometer 29Â·60. Great destruction is
everywhere. In one orchard over 100 trees are down,
in another cherry orchard they are described as lying as
if they were mown with a scythe. The roads are mostly
impassable with huge drifts, so that we can get no communication
at all. No post, no papers. The trains are
all blocked beyond Tavistock, and the telegraph won't
work. No doubt the accounts of the storm will reveal
some curious details. Although the whole of my place
suffered so extensively, in a field just outside there are
several fine oaks which are untouched. I imagine the
storm to have swept down from Dartmoor pretty
well north-easterly, over a high hill and down upon
us, and we must have been right in its vortex: the
trees all show signs of twisting, as if there had been
a circular force. I am curious to see how wide an area
it grasped."</p>

<p>At Saltram House, a country seat of Lord Morley,
four hundred trees were blown down, and damage was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
done to the farm buildings. The kitchen chimney at the
mansion was also blown down, and crashed through the
roof into that apartment.</p>

<p>The very fine beech avenue, leading from the entrance
lodge to the mansion at Bickham, the residence of
Reginald Gill, Esq., banker, of Tavistock, is totally
destroyed.</p>

<p>At Warleigh, the residence of Walter Radcliffe, Esq.,
two thousand trees were blown down, and at Derriford,
P. C. C. Radcliffe, Esq., lost sixty.</p>

<p>In the plantations at St. German's, between two and
three hundred trees were uprooted or broken off. The
park covers four hundred acres, and much of the damage
is in the home plantations.</p>

<p>On the Kitley estate, near Yealmpton, over 1,500 trees
were blown down, amongst them being some of the small
leaf elm for which the property is noted, while on the
Blatchford estate four hundred trees fell.</p>

<p>At Woodtown, near Tavistock, the residence of W. F.
Collier, Esq., hundreds of large trees were blown down,
amongst them being several exceptionally fine American
conifers. At Foxhams, in the same district, M. Collier,
Esq., lost some magnificent Scotch and silver firs and
other trees, many of which had attained a great age. A
large number of conifers and rhododendrons, planted by
Mr. Collier himself some eighteen years ago, also
perished.</p>

<p>Pentillie Castle suffered very severely; the house and
the gardens both escaped with but little damage, but trees
of all sizes and ages were blown down in all directions,
from the majestic oaks of two centuries' growth to the
more recently planted Pinus and other rare and ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
trees and shrubs. So far all the strength of the
woodman's establishment has been directed to the clearing
of the roads and walks, which of itself is a herculean
undertaking. The wreck may be cleared away in time,
but restoration to its former state is impossible.</p>

<p>At Efford Manor, Plymouth, the blizzard struck with
great force the edge of the lane on the eastern side of
the house, and then recoiling, and turning right and left,
uprooted about twenty trees on the northern side, and the
same number on the southern side, leaving the house and
grounds untouched.</p>

<p>At Greenbank, Plymouth, several very fine trees were
lost, and others old and withered were left standing.</p>

<p>On Pitt Farm, near Ottery St. Mary, a magnificent
Scotch fir, standing alone, and measuring fifty-six feet to
the lowest branch, was blown down. This had for many
years been a familiar landmark, and will be greatly missed
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>What transpired at the Elms, Stoke, the residence of
Dr. Metham, our illustration, next page, from a photograph
by Mr. Rowe, Devonport, plainly shows.</p>

<p>To enumerate here the instances of lamentable destruction
to woods, parks, and forests, all similar in character
to the cases recorded above, would be an impossible task.
It will be long before the extent of the damage is fully
known, and where nearly every acre of ground on which
trees stood, more particularly in Devon and West Cornwall,
has been more or less rifled, anything like a comprehensive
account is out of the question. The same
remark applies to the loss of fruit-trees. We have
hundreds of instances of farmers and fruit-growers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have to lament the destruction, in some cases, of whole
orchards; others, not quite so unfortunate, having lost
fruit-trees upon which for various reasons they placed
an especial value. The few facts given are but typical
of many scores of others, special reference to which the
time at our disposal does not permit.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the nurserymen have not met with
any very great loss. Some glass has been broken, but in
the winter season nearly all the valuable stock, with the
exception of choice trees and shrubs, is protected.
Among shrubs, many of the half-hardy specimens are
destroyed, their strength permitting them to stand an
ordinary western winter, but not one of the severity of
that of the memorable blizzard year of 1891.</p>

AFTER THE STORM. THE WATER FAMINE IN
PLYMOUTH.</h2>


<p>As soon as the gale of Monday night and Tuesday had
spent its force, and it became possible for the work of
clearing up to be proceeded with, movements in this
direction were rapidly organized in the Three Towns,
as well as in all other parts of the west where men were
obtainable, or traffic was at all possible. In Plymouth,
Stonehouse and Devonport, the earliest opportunities had
been seized of clearing the snow away from the door-ways;
to free the pavements as a whole was the next important
step; and finally, in the temporarily fine weather
of Wednesday, the congealed masses in the roadways
were attacked, and that to such good purpose, that by the
following Sunday, while traces of the recent fall were
frequent enough, in the majority of the streets pedestrians
could walk about with comfort, and vehicular traffic
was fully resumed. George Street, Plymouth, assumed
before long a very different appearance from that
which it bore on Tuesday morning, when Mr. Heath
took the photograph from which our illustration is reproduced,
and the marvellous wintry mantles that enwrapped
the other portions of the town were removed with equal
despatch. Hundreds of men were employed shovelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the snow into carts, from which it was subsequently tipped
into the sea at Sutton Harbour and the Great Western
Docks.</p>

</div>

<p>The railways by the end of the week had commenced
to run with something like regularity, although there were
one or two temporary hitches at first; and the postal
telegraph services had already been partially restored.
To effect the latter object, large numbers of engineers
had been at work, and in the course of their labours, as
may be supposed, they met with a great deal of discomfort,
and some very startling adventures. Bricklayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
plumbers and plasterers plied a busy trade for weeks
after the storm, their services being required to some
extent in every house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i155.jpg" width="450" height="361" alt="" />
<div class="caption">DEVONPORT PARK.</div>
</div>

<p>At Stonehouse, the main streets were soon freed from
snow, and the usual busy throngs of people began once
more to pass along this highway between Plymouth and
Devonport.</p>

<p>At Devonport, by Friday, in many parts of the town
the snow had quite disappeared, though in several of the
streets heaps of slush remained, and at the railway
station business went on much as usual. In Devonport
Park great quantities of snow remained for a considerable
time, though the paths were cleared, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
traffic for foot-passengers was made easy. Mr. Rowe, of
Devonport, has supplied a photograph of a very familiar
scene in the Park, which is here presented. The view of
the Water Steps, Milehouse Road, is also from a photograph
by the same gentleman.</p>

<p>All over the storm-swept district, farmers were busy
looking for cattle and sheep, and some marvellous
instances have been told of sheep being recovered alive
after being entombed for various lengthy periods, one
term of snow imprisonment lasting as long as sixteen
days.</p>

<p>As early as the Tuesday morning following the storm of
Monday night, Mr. Bellamy, the Plymouth Borough Surveyor,
notified to the inhabitants of that town the imminent
danger of a cessation of the water supply, in consequence
of the blocking by snow of the leat through which the
water is brought into the town. That these warnings
were needed was evident from the fact that since the
Monday night the only water obtainable had been from
the Hartley reservoir, which, when full, contains only two
million gallons, or two days' supply. On Wednesday the
whole of the available staff of the Corporation, including
the men whose usual task is the repairing of the leat, were
set to work, under the personal supervision of Mr.
Bellamy, to clear away the frozen snow which completely
filled the leat at the Head Weir, and prevented the passage
through it of any water from the river. The whole leat
from the Head Weir to Roborough was found to be one
mass of frozen snow. On the same day, the Mayor of
Plymouth, Mr. J. T. Bond, accompanied by Mr. R.
Monk and Mr. G. R. Barrett, set out to walk up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Roborough, to ascertain if possible how the work was
progressing. The Mayor and his companions arrived
safely at Roborough, and were enabled to have communication
by telephone with the borough surveyor who was
at the weir head. They ascertained from him the condition
of the leat, and received an urgent appeal for at
least two hundred more workmen to be sent up immediately.
The party then set out on their return journey,
and again on foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i157.jpg" width="450" height="351" alt="" />
<div class="caption">WATER STEPS, MILEHOUSE ROAD, DEVONPORT.</div>
</div>

<p>Arrived in Plymouth, a meeting of the Water Committee
was hastily convened, and it was ascertained that
four Plymouth contractors would be able to supply about
one hundred men to proceed to Roborough. This force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was inadequate, and consequently the Mayor proceeded
to Devonport, and having stated the case to General
Sir Richard Harrison, K.C.B., commanding the district,
at once received a promise of the services of a
military force of two hundred&mdash;one hundred of the
Welsh Regiment from the North Raglan Barracks, and
another hundred of the Royal Marines, the latter by
permission of Colonel Colwell, second colonel commandant.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the efforts of Mr. Bellamy, ably supplemented
by those of Mr. Duke and Mr. Shadwell, to
make rapid progress with clearing the leat near the well-known
Rock Hotel at Head Weir, had been somewhat
retarded. Many of the labourers employed were
ill-clad, and showed signs of weakness, and when it was
found that no sufficient provision had been made to
supply them with food, they threw down their shovels
and returned to Plymouth. Others, however, worked
gallantly on through the night. On Thursday morning,
things looked more promising. At an early hour the new
contingent of workmen engaged on the previous day, and
the two detachments of the military&mdash;the men of the
Welsh Regiment under Lieutenants de la Chapelle and
Ready, and the Marines commanded by Captain Kelly
and Lieutenants Mullins and Drake-Brockman&mdash;were on
the spot, and these, being divided into gangs, set vigorously
to work on the leat at various points. During the
morning large commissariat supplies were received from
Plymouth, and the men, besides having a plentiful supply
of food, were served at intervals with hot coffee.</p>

<p>Some serious difficulties were encountered, and heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
labour on the part of the civilian labourers and the
soldiers was entailed. There were nearly ten miles of
leat to be cleared, and much of the snow was frozen into
hard solid masses, against which but slow headway could
be made. In some places the leat was completely buried
under frozen snow of great depth, and for hundreds of
yards snow rose in drifts from ten to twelve feet in
height, burying the rails guarding the leat, and rendering
it difficult to trace its course accurately. The young
Welsh soldiers worked well, and the services of the
Marines were found invaluable.</p>

<p>By nightfall, when work ceased, it was found that the
leat had been cleared for a mile and a half from the
Head Weir towards Yennadon. On Yennadon Down
Lieutenant de la Chapelle's men had cleared the way
nearly as far as Dousland, and near the Roborough
Reservoir a clearance of three miles had been made. At
about six o'clock the troops and civilian labourers,
numbering about 450, returned to Yelverton Station, and
ultimately, after a vexatious, but, fortunately, not serious
mishap, reached Plymouth.</p>

<p>Fears were expressed during Thursday night that
there would be another snowstorm on Dartmoor, and
this proved to be the case. A violent gale raged on the
moor, and three feet of snow fell, undoing much of what
the heavy toil of the previous day had accomplished.
Much of the snow that had been removed from the leat
had drifted back, and part of the work had to be done
over again.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, a special train left Millbay with
200 general labourers. There were also 100 Marines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
under Lieutenants Sousbie and Garrett; 150 men of the
Dorset Regiment, under Captain Lushington and Lieutenants
Mangles and Household; and 50 men of the
Welsh Regiment, under Lieutenant Woodville. The
civilians were under the direction of Mr. S. Roberts, and
the Mayor of Plymouth, Mr. G. R. Barrett (deputy-chairman
of the Water Committee), Mr. W. H. Mayne,
Mr. R. Monk, and Mr. G. Bellamy, junior, accompanied
the party. The train had a rough time, on account of
the heavy gale that was blowing, and just before Bickleigh
Station was reached it was brought to a standstill by a
snow-drift. About fifty of the labourers had to cut a way
through the snow, enabling the party, after nearly an
hour's delay, to proceed on their journey.</p>

<p>On arriving at Yelverton the weather was found to be
so bad that, after some consultation, it was considered
advisable to send the military back to Plymouth, and, after
clearing the rails for the return of their own train, they,
with about fifty civilian labourers, started on the return
journey. Mr. Roberts, however, with his men proceeded
along the leat to a point near Clearbrook, but so
fierce was the storm that work could not be commenced,
and an adjacent barn was used as a temporary refuge.
In less than two hours work was begun, and by four
o'clock in the afternoon a clear way of four feet in
width was made from Yelverton Bridge to Roborough
Reservoir, a distance of six miles. A contingent under
the direction of Messrs. T. and W. Shaddock, and another
directed by Mr. Duke had been progressing most
satisfactorily, and, when night approached and success
was within view, all the men expressed their readiness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
work all night if needful, so that the leat might be all
clear before the morning. This, however, was not
necessary, and before seven o'clock a clear passage for
the water had been made along the whole ten miles of
leat. The water had still to be brought on, and a
hundred men volunteered to remain, under Mr. Bellamy,
and work on until a good stream was running. Their
services were accepted, and the other two hundred men,
with the Mayor and Messrs. Roberts and Duke returned
to Plymouth by a special train at nine o'clock. The
great piece of work thus happily accomplished had been
ably assisted by the Mayor of Plymouth, Councillors G.
R. Barrett, and R. A. Monk, and Messrs. A. R.
Debnam, S. Roberts, Duke and Shaddock, contractors
under the Corporation. Mr. Bellamy, with his staff,
Messrs. Prigg, A. G. Davey, S. Chapman, and G. A.
Picken, worked without intermission, and had an
arduous and an anxious time. Messrs. Barrett, Monk,
and Mayne, managed the commissariat department,
which was no light task, with admirable efficiency.
Before the party of workers broke up the Mayor thanked,
in the name of the town of Plymouth, all those who had
assisted in the labour of averting a great calamity.
Thanks were also offered to the railway officials for the
efficiency of the train service. It was not until Sunday
morning that a full supply of water began to flow into
the cisterns, but after Saturday night all apprehension
had ceased, and within a few hours the discomforts of
the previous few days, as far as want of water was concerned,
were removed.</p>

<p>Although great and growing inconvenience was caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
towards the latter end of the week to all the inhabitants
of Plymouth by the partial deprivation of water, things
never reached the same pass as they did in the famine
of 1881. Stonehouse had plenty of water, and was able
to assist in supplying the western end of Plymouth. By
order of the Local Board standpipes were on the Saturday
erected at the Malt House, and in Millbay Road,
Union Place and Eldad Hill, and all day long residents
of Plymouth were supplied from these. In some parts
of Plymouth families were in great difficulty, and water
borrowing, where practicable, went forward on a large
scale. Messrs. Polkinghorne, at their brewery in Bedford
Street, Messrs. Denniford &amp; Son, mineral water manufacturers
of Russel Street, and Mr. Lewis, aÃ«rated water
manufacturer of AthenÃ¦um Street, supplied hundreds of
the inhabitants, free of charge, from their artesian wells.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Plymouth Borough Council subsequently
held, formal votes of thanks were passed to a
number of citizens, as well as the military authorities, for
the services they had rendered, and a rate of remuneration
to the soldiers for their valuable service was fixed upon.</p>

<p>As soon as the Plymouth water difficulty was satisfactorily
overcome, it was discovered that the Devonport
leat, also on Dartmoor, was blocked. Mr. Francis, C. E.,
manager to the Devonport Waterworks Company, set
out for Princetown to inspect the place, and as speedily
as possible gangs of men were put on to work on the
different parts of the leat. Some serious difficulties were
encountered, most of the snow being frozen quite hard,
and forming barriers fifteen feet deep, while in one spot,
near Lowery Lane, a tree, fourteen feet in girth, had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fallen right across the leat. This tree was removed by
means of lifting jacks, after having been cut in two.
After many trials of patience, extending over several
days, the toilers were rewarded with well-deserved
success, and the water once more flowed freely. This
was a fortunate result, for, besides the inhabitants of
Devonport and Stonehouse, the regiments in garrison,
the Naval Barracks, the Engineer Students, and the
Royal Marine Barracks, are dependent on the Devonport
Water Company for their supply of water.</p>

SOME STRANGE EXPERIENCES.</h2>


<p>For many years to come residents of the western
counties will have tales to relate of marvellous incidents,
involving both great and small consequences, that
occurred in connection with this memorable blizzard.
The remarkable tenacity of life exhibited by birds and
animals had been probably wholly unsuspected, until this
recent sudden storm supplied the opportunity for its
discovery. We have already heard of lambs born under
the snow; of geese hatching their young within a day or
two of release from days under a heavy snow coverlid,
which not only covered but enwrapped them; and of
horses being dug out alive and well after a night's chilly
burial.</p>

<p>An experience of this kind, as curious as any, was that of
Mr. J. Trant, of Redlap, Stoke Fleming, who dug a lamb
out of a snow-drift, where it had lain buried for sixteen days.
To quote the words of our informant, "the little creature
seemed none the worse for its long imprisonment, but
began to graze as soon as it was released. I have just
seen it, and it was busy making up for lost time." Mr.
Trevethan, of Beer Barton Farm, Beerferris, also met
with some instances of this kind. After he had succeeded
in releasing his lambs, of which he had missed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
large number, he found them generally weak, and rather
drowsy, but they at once bleated for their mothers, and
their call being answered, they trotted off in the direction
from which the call came. A bottle of gin was kept on
hand for the resuscitation of the recovered creatures, and
its efficacy in imparting the needed warmth is highly
spoken of.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevethan's shepherd was making for his cottage
on Monday evening, carrying with him a basket of provisions
which he had been into the village to purchase.
In attempting to get over a gate, within a short distance
of some outhouses that stood between him and his cottage,
he was separated from his basket by a violent gust
of wind. Picking himself up, he reached his home in
safety, and his basket was found, after a few days, empty.
In the course of the following week, while clearing up
his garden, he discovered, under some feet of snow, a
package of tea, which had formed part of the Monday's
stock of provisions, lost from the basket. The package,
which was unbroken, and in good condition, had evidently
preceded him to his home more than a week before.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hatherley, living near Bickleigh, missed a hen,
which she naturally gave up as lost. After a lapse of ten
days, a cackling was heard to proceed from under a heap
of snow. On going to the place, Mrs. Hatherley was
surprised to find the long-lost hen force an exit through
the snow, and, flapping its wings, make its way home to
the house with all speed. Mrs. Hatherley then examined
the spot, and found on the ground two eggs which the
bird had laid whilst held prisoner by the snow."</p>

<p>Mr. George Sara, of Plymouth, traveller for Messrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Cadbury Bros., was enabled during the Monday night
of the storm to administer comfort to his fellow-travellers.
The train by which he was travelling on the Great
Western line from Penzance to Plymouth became snowed
up at St. German's. Mr. Sara, happening to have his
samples with him, and hot water being available, was
able to dispense cups of chocolate to his companions.
Some Easter eggs, made of chocolate, are described by
the narrator of the story as forming an excellent ingredient
for a beverage of this kind. Approval of the
samples of Messrs. Cadbury Bros.' wares was expressed
by all the belated travellers who had the good fortune to
taste them.</p>

<p>Snow effects resulting from this storm were remarkable
in many places, but perhaps none could be
found more striking than the illustration we give of the
result of leaving open, a few inches, a lattice window,
facing north, at Walreddon Manor, near Tavistock, on
the night of Monday, March 9th. The illustration is
from a photograph kindly supplied by Henry D. Nicholson,
Esq.</p>

<p>At the Land's End the gale was very severe, and the
snowed-up passengers on the omnibus from Penzance to
St. Just on Monday night had a dreadful time. They
left Penzance about six o'clock, and should have reached
St. Just by half-past seven, but it was nine o'clock before
the 'bus reached the point where it had to remain, some
three miles from St. Just. The horses failed to proceed,
and the driver, a young man about 20, was also very
much exhausted. He unhitched the horses, and proceeded
to a farmhouse near and asked for shelter. This
was refused him, the people of the house saying that
there was no room for the horses, as all their cattle were
in the house. He begged for admittance, and offered to
stand by the horses all night, but he was again refused.
Not knowing what else to do, he took the harness off the
horses, turned their heads towards St. Just, and told
them to go home. The horses went off in the darkness,
and he saw them no more. They did not reach home,
but were recovered alive next day. The driver returned
to his passengers in the omnibus, and remained with
them until midday on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. William Penrose, of Bojewan, St. Just, had also a
terrible experience on Monday night. He arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Penzance by the half-past six down-train, intending to
catch the omnibus, but, finding it gone, he walked after
it. Not catching it, he struggled on through the storm
for several hours. Some time in the night he found
himself near a farmhouse. The people of the house had
gone to bed, and there was no light, but he knocked
vigorously at the door, succeeded in awaking the
inmates, and asked to be admitted, as he was well nigh
exhausted. The farmer, however, refused to admit him,
and, after a long rest under the shelter of the house, he
battled again with the storm, determined to make
another effort for life. He finally reached the snowed-up
omnibus at six in the morning more dead than alive,
having been exposed to the storm for twelve hours.
Instances of inhospitality such as these were rare during
the blizzard, and they are worth recording on that
account.</p>

<p>Mr. Theo H. Willcocks relates as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the memorable Monday night, the storm raging
furiously and showing no signs of abating, I left the
Molesworth Arms, Wadebridge, at about eight o'clock,
after being persuaded to do otherwise by the worthy
proprietor, Mr. S. Pollard, and numerous other friends,
and made tracks for Tregorden, some two miles distant.
The town itself was desolate in the extreme, the streets
being absolutely deserted except by a passing chimney-pot
or tile.</p>

<p>"The wind howled and whistled as I wended my way
over the bridge, hurling the flakes in my face with almost
blinding force, but at the far end I found myself greatly
sheltered, and made fairly good progress over the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
until I reached Ball, where I encountered the full force
of the gale. It must have taken me at least ten
minutes making 100 yards, at the end of which I was
thoroughly exhausted, but managed to reach the cottage
occupied by Eliza Burton, which I entered; after furiously
rapping the door to wake the inmates, who had retired
for the night. Here I received the kindest attention,
also severe ridicule from 'Dick,' a person of no mean
size, and the man of the house, for being obliged to
seek help. He immediately volunteered to accompany
me, so after lighting a lantern, and getting tied up
securely, as we thought, from the tempest we closed the
door behind us.</p>

<p>"By this time the snow in the highway was several
inches in depth, and the storm raged with greater
fury than ever. On turning down Tregorden Lane, this
road, though running nearly at right angles to the wind,
was being rapidly filled, for the blizzard came rushing
across a twelve-acre field, with nothing to impede its
course, and, gathering the snow up in clouds, whirled it
along until it reached this sheltered lane, where it came
over the hedge and through the bushes in streams of
sleet, and it was as though we were inhaling icicles, for
when we turned our backs it was just the same. It
pierced our clothes, freezing as it did so, and our hair and
necks became saturated with the driving snow which
formed into a mass of ice. The lane was rapidly
becoming impassable, the snow being now even up to
our waists. In this state we plodded along for a short
distance, I being determined that this time 'Dick' should
be the first to be beaten, and I had not long to wait, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gasped out 'Let's turn back, I am done;' so round we
turned and struggled back to the cottage more dead
than alive, having been out for some twenty-five minutes.
Eliza, prophesying our return, had by this time got up a
roaring fire, and at once forced some hot brandy down
our throats, after which we changed our stiff clothes and
made ourselves comfortable for the night before the fire,
and I enjoyed a cup of tea as I did not know how to
before." On the following day the narrator was able to
proceed to Tregorden.</p>

<p>Among other peculiar and beautiful forms taken by
the blizzard snow, and seen with great effect during the
sunshine of the Wednesday after the storm, were the
huge, shell-shaped hollows scooped out by the wind
from the snow-drifts. An examination of many of our
illustrations will reveal examples of this very unusual
feature. In the accompanying scene, which is a view
of a drift in the Liskeard cricket field, the peculiarity is
very marked, the hollow being apparently sufficiently
deep to cause the surface of the drift to overhang for
some two or three feet.</p>

<p>Brief reference has already been made in another
chapter to the gallant exploits of Mr. Harold S. Williams,
of Torridge, near Plympton. On Tuesday afternoon, at
about five o'clock, he left his home and proceeded
in the direction of the Great Western Railway line.
Making his way in the storm, he found No. 160 engine
standing in a deep drift which had formed on the bridge
crossing the lane leading from the George Hotel. Alone
on the engine was the driver, Coleman, in imminent
danger of being frozen to death. Getting back as fast as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
possible to Torridge, Mr. Williams procured stimulants.
Returning to the driver, he found him almost in a state of
collapse. All he could say was, "I'm dying, I'm dying."
Mr. Williams, who showed great pluck and presence of
mind, got him off the engine, and conducted him towards
Torridge, nearing which a portion of a relief party was
met, and they carried the driver into the house. By that
time he had become unconscious, but restoratives having
been administered, and Coleman's limbs vigorously
rubbed, he in about an hour was restored to partial
consciousness. He remained the guest of Mr. Williams
all night, and next day had sufficiently recovered to be
removed to his home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption">DRIFT, CRICKET FIELD, LISKEARD.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after Coleman had been received into Torridge,
news was brought that another driver, rather
further up the line, was dying. Mr. Williams, who
is only nineteen years of age, again started on
an errand of mercy and rescue. This time he was
accompanied by Mr. Thornton, his tutor, and some of
the relief party, who had helped to carry Coleman into
his hospitable home. About 150 yards beyond
Coleman's engine the party came across another
engine completely buried in the snow, even to the
funnel. Lying near to it was its driver, who had evidently
crawled off the footplate in the hope of reaching shelter
from the bitter snowstorm. At once he was carried to
Torridge, apparently dead, and was laid on a mattress
before a large fire.</p>

<p>An attempt to administer restoratives failed, so tightly
was the man's teeth clenched. All that could be done
was to promote circulation by the warmth of fire and
friction. Rubbing the limbs and body was persevered in,
and at length the man gave a groan. That, however,
was the only sign of life he gave for three hours, during
which time the rubbing was persevered in by relays of
helpers. Two hours afterwards&mdash;that is five hours after
he had been brought in&mdash;he was sufficiently recovered
to speak, but it was some time after that before it could
be said that he was out of danger. When he first
recovered speech he was found to be delirious, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
continued in a state of delirium, more or less, the whole
of the night.</p>

<p>When Mr. C. C. Compton, the divisional superintendent,
called at Torridge early next morning, to
ascertain how the driver was, it was reported that he was
making favourable recovery, but that it would not be
possible to remove him for some days. The man
suffered much in his legs and feet, which are believed to
be considerably frostbitten. His hands appeared to be
all right. He remained some time at Torridge, and was
most carefully tended. Eventually he and the driver
first rescued recovered.</p>

<p>A plucky journey was undertaken on the Wednesday
after the storm by Captain Cowie, R.E., with a view to ascertaining
the damage done between Totnes and Plympton
to the postal telegraph wires, and being unable to proceed
on the journey by rail in consequence of the blocks <i>en route</i>,
he set out from the former place with a determination to
cover the distance on foot. He was the first to attempt
the venturesome task, and the consciousness of the
difficulties that would have to be encountered did not
appear to trouble him. Proceeding as fast as circumstances
would permit, he eventually accomplished the
journey of nineteen miles, meeting with hardly a solitary
individual the whole of the way.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to say that his experiences were
of a most trying and perilous character. The road being
impassable at many points he mounted the hedges, and
occasionally losing his footing he fell into snowdrifts
many feet high, being completely buried. He succeeded
in releasing himself from his dangerous predicament, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on each of the occasions he met with this misfortune
there was absolutely no assistance at hand even should
it have been required. He ultimately reached Kingsbridge
Road, and notwithstanding the adventures which
he had already experienced, he decided to continue the
journey to Plympton.</p>

<p>Having regaled himself with a little milk and some
light refreshment, he started off again, and the remainder
of the journey was no less perilous than the portion
already accomplished had been. He had to wade
through accumulations of snow almost as high as himself,
and was frequently compelled to crawl along on
his hands and knees. He eventually reached Plympton,
saturated with water and sore from the difficult and
dangerous ordeal he had passed through, and here left
instructions for some men to follow him, finding, however,
that the wires <i>en route</i> had suffered very little
damage.</p>
